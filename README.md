[GenSX](https://gensx.com/) is a simple TypeScript framework for building complex LLM applications. It's a workflow engine designed for building agents, chatbots, and long-running workflows.

## Why GenSX?

- üéØ **Pure Functions**: Components are pure TypeScript functions that are easily testable, reusable, and sharable
- üå¥ **Natural Composition**: Building workflows is as simple as composing functions together
- üîí **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with no DSLs or special syntax - just standard language features
- üöÄ **Built for Scale**: Start simple and evolve to complex patterns like agents and reflection without changing your programming model
- üìä **Automatic Tracing**: Real-time tracing of all component inputs/outputs, tool calls, and LLM calls making debugging and observability easy
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **One-Click Deployment**: Deploy workflows as REST APIs with a single command, optimized for long-running LLM workloads up to 60 minutes
- üíæ **Built-in Storage**: Zero-config blob storage, SQL databases, and vector search for building stateful agents and workflows

Check out the [documentation](https://gensx.com/docs) to learn more about building LLM applications with GenSX.

## Building a workflow

Most LLM frameworks are graph oriented--you express your workflow with nodes, edges, and a global state object. GenSX takes a different approach--you compose your workflow with components, and GenSX handles the execution for you.

Components in GenSX look a lot like functions. You create them by passing in a function and a name to `gensx.Component()`, a higher order function::

```tsx
import * as gensx from "@gensx/core";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { generateText } from "@gensx/vercel-ai";

// input interface
interface WriteDraftInput {
  research: string[];
  prompt: string;
}

// components are pure functions that are reusable by default
const WriteDraft = gensx.Component(
  "WriteDraft",
  async ({ prompt, research }: WriteDraftInput) => {
    const systemMessage = `You're an expert technical writer.
    Use the information when responding to users: ${research}`;

    const result = await generateText({
      messages: [
        {
          role: "system",
          content: systemMessage,
        },
        {
          role: "user",
          content: `Write a blog post about ${prompt}`,
        },
      ],
      model: openai("gpt-4.1-mini"),
    });

    return result.text;
  },
);
```

Components can be composed together to create more complex agents and workflows:

```tsx
import * as gensx from "@gensx/core";
import { OpenAIProvider } from "gensx/openai";
import { Research, WriteDraft, EditDraft } from "./writeBlog";

interface WriteBlogInput {
  title: string;
  description: string;
}

const WriteBlog = gensx.Workflow(
  "WriteBlog",
  async ({ title, description }: WriteBlogInput) => {
    const queries = await GenerateQueries({
      title,
      description,
    });
    const research = await ResearchBlog({ queries });
    const draft = await WriteDraft({ title, context: research });
    const final = await EditDraft({ title, content: draft });
    return final;
  },
);

const result = await WriteBlog({
  title: "How AI broke modern infra",
  description: "Long-running workflows require a new approach to infra",
});
```
