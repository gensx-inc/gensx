## Description

This command starts a local development server that:

- Watches your workflow file for changes and automatically reloads
- Provides a web interface to test and debug your workflows
- Simulates the cloud environment locally
- Runs your workflow components in a development mode

The development server includes:

- A web UI for testing your workflows
- Real-time logs and execution visibility
- Access to the GenSX development dashboard

## Examples

```bash
# Start server with a specific workflow file
gensx start src/workflows.tsx

# Start server with a custom project name
gensx start src/workflows.tsx --project my-custom-name

# Start server with minimal output
gensx start src/workflows.tsx --quiet
```

## Notes

- The server runs on port 1337 by default
- You can access the development UI at `http://localhost:1337/swagger-ui`
- Environment variables from your local environment are available to the workflow
- For more complex environment variable setups, consider using a `.env` file in your project root
