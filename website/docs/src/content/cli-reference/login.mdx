# gensx login

The `gensx login` command authenticates you with GenSX Cloud, allowing you to deploy and run workflows remotely.

## Usage

```bash
gensx login
```

## Description

When you run this command, it will:

1. Open your default web browser to the GenSX authentication page
2. Prompt you to log in with your GenSX account or create a new one
3. Store your authentication credentials locally for future CLI commands

After successful login, you can use other commands that require authentication, such as `deploy` and `run`.

## Examples

```bash
# Log in to GenSX Cloud
gensx login
```

## Notes

- Your authentication token is stored in your user directory (typically `~/.gensx/config.json`)
- The token is valid until you log out or revoke it from the GenSX dashboard
- If you're behind a corporate firewall or using strict network policies, ensure that outbound connections to `api.gensx.com` are allowed
