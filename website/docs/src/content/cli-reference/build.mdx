# gensx build

The `gensx build` command compiles and bundles a GenSX workflow for deployment to GenSX Cloud.

## Usage

```bash
gensx build <file> [options]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description                                                                                                    |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<file>` | Workflow file to build (e.g., `src/workflows.tsx`). This should export a GenSX Workflow as the default export. |

## Options

| Option                  | Description                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `-o, --out-dir <dir>`   | Output directory for the built files.           |
| `-t, --tsconfig <file>` | Path to a custom TypeScript configuration file. |
| `-h, --help`            | Display help for the command.                   |

## Description

This command builds your GenSX workflow into an optimized bundle that can be deployed to GenSX Cloud. It:

- Transpiles TypeScript to JavaScript
- Bundles all dependencies
- Optimizes the code for production
- Prepares the workflow for deployment

After building, the command outputs the path to the bundled file, which can be used with the `gensx deploy` command.

## Examples

```bash
# Build a workflow with default options
gensx build src/workflows.tsx

# Build a workflow with a custom output directory
gensx build src/workflows.tsx --out-dir ./dist

# Build a workflow with a custom TypeScript configuration
gensx build src/workflows.tsx --tsconfig ./custom-tsconfig.json
```

## Notes

- The build process requires that your workflow file exports a GenSX Workflow as the default export
- If no output directory is specified, the built files will be placed in a `.gensx/build` directory
- The build process does not include environment variables - these should be provided during deployment
