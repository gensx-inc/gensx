# gensx run

The `gensx run` command executes a workflow that has been deployed to GenSX Cloud. By default it infers your project from the `gensx.yaml` file in the current working directory.

## Usage

```bash
gensx run <workflow> [options]
```

## Arguments

| Argument     | Description                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `<workflow>` | Name of the workflow to run. |

## Options

| Option                 | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-i, --input <input>`  | Input to pass to the workflow (as JSON).                     |
| `--no-wait`            | Do not wait for the workflow to finish (run asynchronously). |
| `-p, --project <name>` | Project name where the workflow is deployed.                 |
| `-o, --output <file>`  | Output file to write the workflow result to.                 |
| `-h, --help`           | Display help for the command.                                |

## Description

This command triggers execution of a deployed workflow on GenSX Cloud with the specified input. By default, it waits for the workflow to complete and displays the result.

When running a workflow, you can:

- Provide input data as JSON
- Choose whether to wait for completion or run asynchronously
- Save the output to a file

## Examples

```bash
# Run a workflow with no input
gensx run MyWorkflow

# Run a workflow with JSON input
gensx run MyWorkflow --input '{"text": "Hello, world!"}'

# Run a workflow in a specific project
gensx run MyWorkflow --project my-production-project

# Run a workflow asynchronously (don't wait for completion)
gensx run MyWorkflow --no-wait

# Run a workflow and save output to a file
gensx run MyWorkflow --output result.json
```

## Notes

- You must be logged in to GenSX Cloud to run workflows (`gensx login`)
- The workflow must have been previously deployed using `gensx deploy`
- When using `--input`, the input must be valid JSON
- When using `--no-wait`, the command returns immediately with a workflow ID that can be used to check status later
- Error handling: if the workflow fails, the command will return with a non-zero exit code and display the error
