# gensx env unselect

The `gensx env unselect` command de-selects the currently selected environment for your project. This means subsequent commands will require explicit environment specification.

## Usage

```bash
gensx env unselect [options]
```

## Options

| Option                  | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-p, --project <name>`  | Project name to unselect the environment in.                                 |
| `-h, --help`            | Display help for the command.                                                |

## Description

This command:

1. Removes the currently selected environment for your project
2. Updates your local configuration to clear the selection
3. Requires explicit environment specification for subsequent commands

After unselecting an environment:
- `gensx deploy` will require the `--env` option
- `gensx run` will require the `--env` option
- You'll need to either select a new environment or specify the environment for each command

## Examples

```bash
# Unselect the current environment
gensx env unselect

# Unselect environment in a specific project
gensx env unselect --project my-app
```

## Notes

- You must be logged in to GenSX Cloud to unselect environments (`gensx login`)
- Unselecting an environment does not delete it
- You can check if an environment is selected using `gensx env show`
- To select a new environment, use `gensx env select`
- After unselecting, you'll need to specify the environment for each command that requires one
