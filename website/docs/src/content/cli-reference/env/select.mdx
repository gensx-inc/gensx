After selecting an environment:

- You can still override the environment for specific commands using the `--env` option

## Examples

gensx env select dev

# Select a production environment in a specific project
gensx env select production --project my-app
```

## Notes

- You must be logged in to GenSX Cloud to select environments (`gensx login`)
- The selected environment persists across CLI sessions
- You can check the currently selected environment using `gensx env show`
- To unselect an environment, use `gensx env unselect`
