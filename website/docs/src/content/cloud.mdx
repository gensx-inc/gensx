# GenSX Cloud Platform

GenSX Cloud is a complete platform for building, deploying, and operating AI applications. It provides serverless deployment, zero-configuration storage, and real-time monitoring capabilities for your workflows and agents.

The platform is designed to handle the unique requirements of AI applications:
- **Serverless deployment** optimized for long-running AI workloads
- **Zero-configuration storage** for stateful agents and workflows
- **Comprehensive visibility** into workflow execution
- **Pay-per-second pricing** with a generous free tier

## Serverless Deployment

Deploy any GenSX workflow to a hosted API endpoint with a single command:

```bash
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts
```

Each workflow is automatically exposed as a REST API that supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution modes, as well as streaming responses.

Key benefits:
- **Single-digit millisecond cold starts**
- **Support for long-running executions** up to an hour
- **Automatic API generation** for each workflow
- **Pay-per-second pricing** with a generous free tier

## Development Server

Test your workflows locally with a development server that mimics the cloud environment:

```bash
gensx start src/workflows.ts
```

This creates local API endpoints for each workflow, allowing you to test and debug your application without deploying to the cloud. The server automatically reloads when you make changes to your code.

## Cloud Storage

GenSX Cloud provides zero-configuration storage solutions for your AI applications:

### Blob Storage

Store and retrieve unstructured data with the `useBlob` hook:

```tsx
const blob = useBlob<ChatMessage[]>(`chat-history/${threadId}.json`);
const history = await blob.getJSON();
// ...
await blob.putJSON(updatedHistory);
```

Perfect for implementing agent memory, storing intermediate results, or persisting user data.

### Database

Create and use SQL databases on demand with the `useDatabase` hook:

```tsx
const db = await useDatabase("baseball");
const result = await db.execute("SELECT * FROM baseball_stats WHERE player = 'Babe Ruth'");
```

Ideal for text-to-SQL applications, storing structured data, or implementing RAG patterns.

### Search (Coming Soon)

Full-text and vector search capabilities will be available soon through the `useSearch` hook, making it easy to implement RAG and semantic search.

## Workflow Visibility

When building complex AI workflows and agents, one of the primary challenges is understanding the result of each step and how workflow steps work together to get the desired outcome.

The GenSX Cloud console provides comprehensive visibility into your workflow executions:

1. Go to the [GenSX console](https://app.gensx.com).
2. Navigate to the **Workflows** tab to view all workflow executions.
3. When a workflow starts, it will appear in the Workflow Executions list as **In Progress** (this can take up to a minute).
4. Click on a workflow to view:
   - **Live Execution Details**
   - **Each Workflow Step**
   - **Step Inputs & Outputs**
   - **Nested Child Steps**

This allows you to track workflow execution in real-time and which makes debugging and iterating on your workflows a breeze.

## Getting Started

### 1. Creating an Account & Organization

To create an account and organization in the GenSX console:

1. Navigate to the [sign-up page](https://signin.gensx.com/sign-up).
2. Sign up with your email address. The organization is automatically created based on your email domain.
   - Example: If you sign up with `user@example.com`, your organization will be named `example`.
   - Currently, you **cannot** rename, delete, or create additional organizations.
3. You can add additional members to your organization via the **Members** tab in the GenSX console.
   - Note: during the beta, there are no limits on the number of members you can have but that may change when the beta ends.

### 2. Setting Up Your Credentials (API Keys)

To generate and use API keys:

1. Navigate to the **API Keys** tab in the GenSX console.
2. Click **Create Key** to generate a personal API key.
   - This key is currently valid across all organizations you have access to (in the future, keys will be org-specific).
3. To enable tracing, set the following environment variables in the environment where you're running utilizing GenSX:
   ```sh
   export GENSX_API_KEY=your_api_key
   export GENSX_ORG=your_org_name
   ```

_Note: While the product is in beta it available to you
to try out without any limitations or restrictions. As GenSX Cloud moves out of beta, there will be
a generous free tier along with a paid offering that will
give you access to additional capabilities and expanded usage limits._
