# Structured outputs

Workflows regularly require getting structured outputs (JSON) from LLMs. GenSX supports an easy way to get structured outputs from an LLM by using the `GSXChatCompletion` component and Zod. However, you can also use the `response_format` prop to get a structured output from OpenAI models without using GenSX helpers, just like you would when using the OpenAI SDK or API.

This guide shows how to use structured outputs with both [@gensx/openai](docs/components/openai) and [@gensx/vercel-ai](docs/components/vercel-ai). You can also find similar examples in [OpenAI examples](https://github.com/gensx-inc/gensx/tree/main/examples/openai-examples) and [Vercel AI examples](https://github.com/gensx-inc/gensx/tree/main/examples/vercel-ai) in the GitHub repo.

## Structured outputs with the Vercel AI SDK

The [`@gensx/vercel-ai`](docs/components/vercel-ai) package provides two ways to get structured outputs from LLMs: `generateObject` and `streamObject`. Two key benefits of using the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-structured-data) are that you can stream the output as it's generated, and you can use it with models that don't natively support structured outputs.

### Using `generateObject`

Start by defining the Zod schema for the output format you want:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

const ExtractEntitiesSchema = z.object({
  people: z.array(z.string()),
  places: z.array(z.string()),
  organizations: z.array(z.string()),
});
```

Then define the component and set the `schema` param on the `generateObject` function:

```ts
interface ExtractEntitiesInput {
  text: string;
}

const ExtractEntities = gensx.Component(
  "ExtractEntities",
  ({ text }: ExtractEntitiesInput) => {
    const prompt = `Please review the following text and extract all the people, places, and organizations mentioned.

  <text>
  ${text}
  </text>

  Please return json with the following format:
  {
    "people": ["person1", "person2", "person3"],
    "places": ["place1", "place2", "place3"],
    "organizations": ["org1", "org2", "org3"]
  }`;
    const result = generateObject({
      model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
      schema: ExtractEntitiesSchema,
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
    });

    return result.object;
  },
);
```

When you run this component, it will return the structured output directly matching the type of the `ExtractEntitiesSchema` with no extra parsing required.

### Using `streamObject`

The `streamObject` function is similar to `generateObject` but it streams the output as it's generated.

```ts
const ExtractEntitiesStreaming = gensx.Component(
  "ExtractEntitiesStreaming",
  ({ text }: ExtractEntitiesInput) => {
    const prompt = `Please review the following text and extract all the people, places, and organizations mentioned.

  <text>
  ${text}
  </text>

  Please return json with the following format:
  {
    "people": ["person1", "person2", "person3"],
    "places": ["place1", "place2", "place3"],
    "organizations": ["org1", "org2", "org3"]
  }`;
    const result = streamObject({
      model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
      schema: ExtractEntitiesSchema,
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
    });

    const generator = async function* () {
      for await (const chunk of result.partialObjectStream) {
        yield chunk;
      }
    };

    return generator();
  },
);
```

Then you can consume the output of the component like this:

```ts
const structuredStreamResult = await ExtractEntitiesStreaming({
  text: "John Doe is a software engineer at Google.",
});
console.log("Response:");
for await (const chunk of structuredStreamResult) {
  console.clear();
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

## Structured outputs with the OpenAI SDK

You can also use the [`@gensx/openai`](docs/components/openai) package to get structured outputs from OpenAI models and compatible APIs.

The OpenAI SDK provides a `parse` method that you can use to automatically parse the response of the structured output.

Here's an example of how to extract entities using the OpenAI SDK:

```ts
import { OpenAI } from "@gensx/openai";
import { zodResponseFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod.mjs";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const EntityExtractionSchema = z.object({
  people: z.array(z.string()).describe("List of people mentioned in the text"),
  places: z.array(z.string()).describe("List of places mentioned in the text"),
  organizations: z
    .array(z.string())
    .describe("List of organizations mentioned in the text"),
});

const ExtractEntities = gensx.Component(
  "ExtractEntities",
  async ({ text }: { text: string }) => {
    const result = await openai.beta.chat.completions.parse({
      model: "gpt-4",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "user",
          content: `Please extract all people, places, and organizations from this text:\n\n${text}`,
        },
      ],
      response_format: zodResponseFormat(
        EntityExtractionSchema,
        "entityExtraction",
      ),
    });

    return result.choices[0].message.parsed!;
  },
);
```

When you run this component, it will return a typed object matching the `EntityExtractionSchema` structure. The `parse` method ensures that the response is properly validated against your schema before returning it.

You can use it like this:

```ts
const result = await ExtractEntities({
  text: "John works at Google in New York City.",
});

console.log(result);
// Output:
// {
//   people: ["John"],
//   places: ["New York City"],
//   organizations: ["Google"]
// }
```

Alternatively, you can just call `openai.chat.completions.create` and then parse the response yourself with Zod:

```ts
const parsed = EntityExtractionSchema.parse(result.choices[0].message.content);
```
