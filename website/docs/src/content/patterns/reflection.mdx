# Self-reflection

Self-reflection is a common prompting technique used to improve the outputs of LLMs. With self-reflection, an LLM is used to evaluate it's own output and then improve it, similar to how a humans would review and edit their own work.

Self-reflection works well because it's easy for LLMs to make mistakes. LLMs are simply predicting tokens one after the next so a single bad token choice can create a cascading effect. Self-reflection allows the model to evaluate the output in its entirety giving the model a chance to catch and correct any mistakes.

## Self-reflection in GenSX

The nested approach to creating GenSX workflows might make it seem difficult to implement looping patterns like self-reflection. However, GenSX allows you to express dynamic, programmatic trees giving you all the flexibility you need.

The [reflection example](https://github.com/gensx-inc/gensx/tree/main/examples/reflection) defines a helper function `createReflectionLoop` that you can use to implement self-reflection in your GenSX workflows.

To implement self-reflection, you'll need:

1. **An evaluation component** that assesses the output and provides feedback
2. **An improvement component** that processes the input using the feedback to create a better output

The output you want to improve becomes the `input` to the reflection loop itself. You can choose to run a single round of self-reflection or multiple rounds to iteratively refine the output, based on your scenario.

When you call `createReflectionLoop`, the function will:

1. Use the evaluation component (`EvaluateFn`) to analyze the output and decide if further improvements are necessary.
2. If improvements are warranted, execute the improvement component (`ImproveFn`) to refine the output.
3. Recursively call itself with the improved output, continuing until the specified `maxIterations` is reached or no more improvements are needed.

Here's the implementation of the `createReflectionLoop` function:

```tsx
export function createReflectionLoop<TInput>(name: string) {
  return gsx.Component<ReflectionProps<TInput>, TInput>(
    name,
    async ({
      input,
      ImproveFn,
      EvaluateFn,
      iterations = 0,
      maxIterations = 3,
    }) => {
      // Check if we should continue processing
      const { feedback, continueProcessing } =
        await gsx.execute<ReflectionOutput>(<EvaluateFn input={input} />);

      if (continueProcessing && iterations < maxIterations) {
        // Process the input
        const newInput: TInput = await gsx.execute<TInput>(
          <ImproveFn input={input} feedback={feedback} />,
        );

        // Recursive call with updated input and iteration count
        const Reflection = createReflectionLoop<TInput>(
          `${name}-${iterations + 1}`,
        );
        return (
          <Reflection
            input={newInput}
            ImproveFn={ImproveFn}
            EvaluateFn={EvaluateFn}
            iterations={iterations + 1}
            maxIterations={maxIterations}
          />
        );
      }

      // Return the final input when we're done processing
      return input;
    },
  );
}
```

## Implementing self-reflection

Now that you've seen the pattern and the helper function for doing self-reflection, let's implement it. The example below shows how to use the `createReflectionLoop` function to evaluate and improve text.

### Step 1: Define the evaluation component

First, you need to define the component that will be used to evaluate the text. As its designed above, the evaluation component needs to return a string, `feedback`, and a boolean, `continueProcessing`.

To get good results, you'll need to provide useful instructions on what feedback to provide. In this example, we focus on trying to make the text sound more authentic and less AI-generated.

```tsx
const EvaluateText = gsx.Component<{ input: string }, ReflectionOutput>(
  "EvaluateText",
  ({ input }) => {
    const systemPrompt = `You're a helpful assistant that evaluates text and suggests improvements if needed.

    ## Evaluation Criteria

    - Check for genuine language: flag any buzzwords, corporate jargon, or empty phrases like "cutting-edge solutions"
    - Look for clear, natural expression: mark instances of flowery language or clich√©d openers like "In today's landscape..."
    - Review word choice: highlight where simpler alternatives could replace complex or technical terms
    - Assess authenticity: note when writing tries to "sell" rather than inform clearly and factually
    - Evaluate tone: identify where the writing becomes overly formal instead of warm and conversational
    - Consider flow and engagement - flag where transitions feel choppy or content becomes dry and predictable


    ## Output Format
    Return your response as JSON with the following two properties:

    - feedback: A string describing the improvements that can be made to the text. Return feedback as short bullet points. If no improvements are needed, return an empty string.
    - continueProcessing: A boolean indicating whether the text should be improved further. If no improvements are needed, return false.

    You will be given a piece of text. Your job is to evaluate the text and return a JSON object with the following format:
    {
      "feedback": "string",
      "continueProcessing": "boolean"
    }
    `;
    return (
      <ChatCompletion
        model="gpt-4o-mini"
        messages={[
          { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
          { role: "user", content: input },
        ]}
        response_format={{ type: "json_object" }}
      >
        {(response: string) => {
          return JSON.parse(response) as ReflectionOutput;
        }}
      </ChatCompletion>
    );
  },
);
```

### Step 2: Define the improvement component

Next, you need to define the component that will be used to improve the text. This component will take the `input` text and the `feedback` as input and return the improved text.

```tsx
const ImproveText = gsx.Component<{ input: string; feedback: string }, string>(
  "ImproveText",
  ({ input, feedback }) => {
    console.log("\nüìù Current draft:\n", input);
    console.log("\nüîç Feedback:\n", feedback);
    console.log("=".repeat(50));
    const systemPrompt = `You're a helpful assistant that improves text by fixing typos, removing buzzwords, jargon, and making the writing sound more authentic.

    You will be given a piece of text and feedback on the text. Your job is to improve the text based on the feedback. You should return the improved text and nothing else.`;
    const prompt = `<feedback>
    ${feedback}
    </feedback>

    <text>
    ${input}
    </text>`;
    return (
      <ChatCompletion
        model="gpt-4o-mini"
        messages={[
          { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
          { role: "user", content: prompt },
        ]}
      />
    );
  },
);
```

### Step 3: Create the reflection loop

Now that you have the evaluation and improvement components, you can create the reflection loop.

```tsx
export const ImproveTextWithReflection = gsx.Component<
  {
    text: string;
    maxIterations?: number;
  },
  string
>("ImproveTextWithReflection", ({ text, maxIterations = 3 }) => {
  const Reflection = createReflectionLoop<string>("ImproveTextWithReflection");
  return (
    <OpenAIProvider apiKey={process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}>
      <Reflection
        input={text}
        ImproveFn={ImproveText}
        EvaluateFn={EvaluateText}
        maxIterations={maxIterations}
      />
    </OpenAIProvider>
  );
});
```

### Step 4: Run the example

You can run the text improvement example using the following code:

```tsx
const text = `We are a cutting-edge technology company leveraging bleeding-edge AI solutions to deliver best-in-class products to our customers. Our agile development methodology ensures we stay ahead of the curve with paradigm-shifting innovations.`;

const workflow = gsx.Workflow("ReflectionWorkflow", ImproveTextWithReflection);
const improvedText = await workflow.run({ text });

console.log("üéØ Final text:\n", improvedText);
```

You can find the complete example code in the [reflection example](https://github.com/gensx-inc/gensx/tree/main/examples/reflection).
