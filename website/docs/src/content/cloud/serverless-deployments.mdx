# Serverless deployments

Deploy your GenSX workflows as serverless APIs with support for both synchronous and asynchronous execution, as well as long-running operations.

The GenSX Cloud serverless runtime is for near zero cold starts

## Deploy with the CLI

Projects are a collection of workflows and environment variables that deploy together into an `environment` that you configure.

Each project has a `gensx.yaml` file at the root and a `workflows.tsx` file that exports all of your deployable workflows.

Run `gensx deploy` from the root of your project to deploy it:

```bash
# Deploy the workflow file with default settings
npx gensx deploy src/workflows.tsx

# Deploy with environment variables
npx gensx deploy src/workflows.tsx -ev OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Environment variables are encrypted with per-project encryption keys.

### Deploying to different environments

GenSX supports multiple environments within a project (such as development, staging, and production) to help manage your deployment lifecycle.

```bash
# Deploy to a specific environment
npx gensx deploy src/workflows.tsx --environment production

# Deploy to staging with environment-specific variables
npx gensx deploy src/workflows.tsx --environment staging -ev OPENAI_API_KEY -ev LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

Each environment can have its own configuration and environment variables, allowing you to test in isolation before promoting changes to production.

When you deploy a workflow, GenSX:

1. Builds your TypeScript code for production
2. Bundles your dependencies
3. Uploads the package to GenSX Cloud
4. Configures serverless infrastructure
5. Creates API endpoints for each exported workflow
6. Encrypts and sets up environment variables
7. Activates the deployment

The entire process typically takes a few seconds.

## Running Workflows from the CLI

Once deployed, you can execute workflows directly from the CLI:

```bash
# Run a workflow synchronously with input data
npx gensx run MyWorkflow --input '{"prompt":"Generate a business name"}' --project my-app

# Run and save the output to a file
npx gensx run MyWorkflow --input '{"prompt":"Generate a business name"}' --wait --output results.json

# Run asynchronously (start the workflow but don't wait for completion)
npx gensx run MyWorkflow --input '{"prompt":"Generate a business name"}' --project my-app
```

### CLI Run Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--input` | JSON string with input data |
| `--wait` | Wait for workflow completion and return results |
| `--output` | Save results to a file (requires `--wait`) |
| `--project` | Specify the project name |

## API Endpoints

Each workflow is exposed as an API endpoint:

```
https://api.gensx.com/v1/org/{org}/projects/{project}/environments/{environment}/workflows/{workflow}/run
```

- `{org}` - Your organization ID
- `{project}` - Your project name
- `{environment}` - The environment (defaults to "default")
- `{workflow}` - The name of your workflow

For example, if you have a workflow named `BlogWriter` in project `content-tools`, the endpoint would be:
```
https://api.gensx.com/v1/org/your-org/projects/content-tools/environments/default/workflows/BlogWriter/run
```

## Authentication

All GenSX Cloud API endpoints require authentication using your GenSX API key as a bearer token:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gensx.com/v1/org/your-org/projects/your-project/environments/default/workflows/YourWorkflow/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Tell me about GenSX"}'
```

### Obtaining an API Key

To generate or manage API keys:

1. Log in to the [GenSX Cloud dashboard](https://app.gensx.com)
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Create a new key

## Execution Modes

### Synchronous Execution

By default, API calls execute synchronously, returning the result when the workflow completes:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gensx.com/v1/org/your-org/projects/your-project/environments/default/workflows/YourWorkflow/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Tell me about GenSX"}'
```

### Asynchronous Execution

For longer-running workflows, use asynchronous execution by calling the `/start` endpoint:

```bash
# Request asynchronous execution
curl -X POST https://api.gensx.com/v1/org/your-org/projects/your-project/environments/default/workflows/YourWorkflow/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Tell me about GenSX"}'

# Response includes an execution ID
# {
#   "status": "ok",
#   "data": {
#     "executionId": "exec_123abc"
#   }
# }

# Check status later
curl -X GET https://api.gensx.com/v1/executions/exec_123abc \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"
```

### Streaming Responses

For workflows that support streaming, you can receive tokens as they're generated:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gensx.com/v1/org/your-org/projects/your-project/environments/default/workflows/YourWorkflow/run?stream=true \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Tell me about GenSX"}'
```

The response is delivered as a stream of server-sent events (SSE).

## Execution time limits

GenSX Cloud is optimized for long-running workflows and agents, with generous execution time limits:

| Plan | Maximum Execution Time |
|------|------------------------|
| Free Tier | Up to 5 minutes |
| Pro Tier | Up to 60 minutes |
| Enterprise | Custom limits available |

These extended timeouts make GenSX ideal for complex AI workflows that might involve:
- Multiple LLM calls in sequence
- Real-time agent tool use
- Complex data processing
- Extensive RAG operations


## Cold Starts and Performance

The GenSX Cloud serverless architecture is designed to minimize cold starts:

- **Millisecond-level cold starts**: Initial cold starts typically range from 10-30ms
- **Warm execution**: Subsequent executions of recently used workflows start in 1-5ms
- **Auto-scaling**: Infrastructure automatically scales with workloads

## Managing deployments in the console

GenSX Cloud provides a console to run, debug, and view all of your workflows.

### Viewing workflows

![View projects in the console](/cloud/console-workflows.png)

1. Log in to [app.gensx.com](https://app.gensx.com)
2. Navigate to your project and environment
3. The Workflows tab shows all deployed workflows with status information
4. Click on a workflow to view its details, including schema, recent executions, and performance metrics

The workflow page includes API documentation and code snippets that you can copy/paste to run your workflow from within another app:

### Running Workflows Manually

You can test workflows directly from the console:

1. Navigate to the workflow detail page
2. Click the "Run" button
3. Enter JSON input in the provided editor
4. Choose execution mode (sync, async, or streaming)
5. View results directly in the console

### Viewing Execution History

Each workflow execution generates a trace you can review:

1. Navigate to the "Executions" tab in your project
2. Browse the list of recent executions
3. Click on any execution to see detailed traces
4. Explore the component tree, inputs/outputs, and execution timeline
