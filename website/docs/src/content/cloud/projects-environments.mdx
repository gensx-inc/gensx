# Projects and environments

GenSX organizes your workflows and deployments using a flexible structure of projects and environments, making it easy to match the rest of your application architecture and CI/CD topology.

## Project Structure

A project in GenSX is a collection of related workflows that are deployed, managed, and monitored together:

- **Projects as logical units**: Group related workflows that serve a common purpose
- **Shared configuration**: Apply settings across all workflows in a project
- **Collective deployment**: Deploy all workflows within a project in one operation
- **Unified monitoring**: View traces and metrics for an entire project

Projects typically correspond to a codebase or application that contains multiple workflows.

## Environment separation

Within each project, you can have multiple environments:

- **Development**: For building and testing new features
- **Staging**: For pre-production validation
- **Production**: For live, user-facing workflows
- **Custom environments**: Create any specialized environments you need

Each environment maintains separate:
- Workflow deployments
- Configuration and environment variables
- Execution traces and monitoring data

## Configuring projects

### Project configuration file

Projects are defined using a `gensx.yaml` file at the root of your codebase:

```yaml
# gensx.yaml
projectName: customer-support-bot
description: AI assistant for customer support
```

This configuration applies to both local development and cloud deployments.

## Working with environments

### Deploying to different environments

Deploy your workflows to specific environments using the CLI:

```bash
# Deploy to the default environment
gensx deploy src/workflows.tsx

# Deploy to a staging environment
gensx deploy src/workflows.tsx --environment staging

# Deploy to production
gensx deploy src/workflows.tsx --environment production
```

### Environment-specific configuration

Set environment-specific variables during deployment:

```bash
# Development-specific settings
gensx deploy src/workflows.tsx --environment development \
  --env LOG_LEVEL=debug \
  --env OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4

# Production-specific settings
gensx deploy src/workflows.tsx --environment production \
  --env LOG_LEVEL=error \
  --env OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo
```

## Projects in the GenSX Console

The GenSX Console organizes everything by project and environment:

Selecting an environment brings you to the workflows view:

![Environment page](/cloud/console-workflows.png)

From here you can trigger a workflow within the console for workflows deployed to GenSX Cloud serverless:

You can also see API documentation and sample code for triggering those workflows:
