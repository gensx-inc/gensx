# Projects and environments

GenSX organizes your workflows and deployments using a flexible structure of projects and environments, making it easy to match the rest of your application architecture and CI/CD topology. Projects are a top level resource and environments are instances of a project that you deploy to.

## Project structure

A project in GenSX is a collection of related workflows that are deployed, managed, and monitored together:

- **Projects as logical units**: Group related workflows that serve a common purpose
- **Shared configuration**: Apply settings across all workflows in a project
- **Collective deployment**: Deploy all workflows within a project in one operation
- **Unified monitoring**: View traces and metrics for an entire project

Projects typically correspond to a codebase or application that contains multiple workflows.

## Environment separation

Within each project, you can have multiple environments. For example, you could create three environments for each project:

- **Development**: For building and testing new features
- **Staging**: For pre-production validation
- **Production**: For live, user-facing workflows

You have full control over your environments so you can organize them however you see fit.

Each environment maintains separate:

- Workflow deployments
- Configuration and environment variables
- Execution traces and monitoring data

## Configuring projects

### Project configuration file

Projects are defined using a `gensx.yaml` file at the root of your codebase:

```yaml
# gensx.yaml
projectName: customer-support-bot
description: AI assistant for customer support
```

This configuration applies to both local development and cloud deployments.

## Working with environments

### Deploying to different environments

Deploy your workflows to specific environments using the CLI:

```bash
# Deploy to the default environment
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts

# Deploy to a staging environment
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts --env staging

# Deploy to production
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts --env production
```

### Environment-specific configuration

Set environment-specific variables during deployment:

```bash
# Development-specific settings
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts --env development \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=debug \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY

# Production-specific settings
gensx deploy src/workflows.ts --env production \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=error \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## Projects in the GenSX Console

The GenSX Console organizes everything by project and environment:

Selecting an environment brings you to the workflows view:

When you click into a workflow, you can trigger it within the console if you've deployed it to GenSX Cloud:

You can also see API documentation and sample code for calling that workflow:
