# Typescript Compatibility

GenSX is designed to be compatible with TypeScript. This page has some tips and tricks for using GenSX with TypeScript.

## Minimum TypeScript Version

GenSX requires TypeScript version 5.1 or higher.

## TypeScript Configuration

- `target` should be set to at least `es6`
- `module` should be set to at least `es6`
- `jsx` should be set to `react-jsx`
- `jsxImportSource` should be set to `@gensx/core`

### JSX Pragmas

If you are unable to change the `jsx` or `jsxImportSource` settings in your TypeScript configuration, you can use the following pragmas to enable GenSX:

```tsx
/** @jsxRuntime automatic */
/** @jsxImportSource @gensx/core */
```

## ESM Compatibility

GenSX is designed to be compatible with ESM. This means that you can use it in any environment that supports ESM. At this time, GenSX is not compatible with CommonJS.
