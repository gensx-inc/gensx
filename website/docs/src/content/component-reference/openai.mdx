# OpenAI

The [@gensx/openai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gensx/openai) package provides a pre-wrapped version of the OpenAI SDK for GenSX, making it easy to use OpenAI's API with GenSX functionality.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @gensx/openai openai
```

## Usage

You can use this package in two ways:

### 1. Drop-in Replacement (Recommended)

Simply replace your OpenAI import with the GenSX version:

```ts
// Instead of:
// import { OpenAI } from 'openai';

// Use:
import { OpenAI } from "@gensx/openai";

// Create a client as usual
const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
});

// All methods are automatically wrapped with GenSX functionality
const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});

// Use embeddings
const embedding = await client.embeddings.create({
  model: "text-embedding-ada-002",
  input: "Hello world!",
});

// Use responses
const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});
```

### 2. Wrap an Existing Instance

If you already have an OpenAI instance, you can wrap it with GenSX functionality:

```ts
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { wrapOpenAI } from "@gensx/openai";

// Create your OpenAI instance as usual
const client = wrapOpenAI(
  new OpenAI({
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
  }),
);

// Now all methods are wrapped with GenSX functionality
const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});
```

## API Reference

The package exports:

1. `OpenAI` - A drop-in replacement for the OpenAI client that automatically wraps all methods with GenSX functionality
2. `wrapOpenAI` - A function to manually wrap an OpenAI instance with GenSX functionality

All methods from the OpenAI SDK are supported and automatically wrapped with GenSX functionality, including:

- Chat Completions
- Embeddings
- Responses
- And all other OpenAI API endpoints

The wrapped methods maintain the same interface as the original OpenAI SDK, so you can use them exactly as you would with the standard OpenAI client.
