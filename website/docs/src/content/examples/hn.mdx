# Hacker News analyzer

The [Hacker News Analyzer](https://github.com/gensx-inc/gensx/tree/main/examples/hacker-news-analyzer) example uses GenSX to fetch, analyze, and extract trends from the top Hacker News posts. It shows how to combine data fetching, parallel analysis, and content generation in a single workflow to create two outputs: a detailed report and a tweet of the trends.

## Workflow

The Hacker News Analyzer workflow is composed of the following steps:

1. Fetch the top 500 Hacker News posts and filters down to `text` posts (`FetchHNPosts`)
2. Process each post in parallel (`AnalyzeHNPosts`)
   - Summarize the content (`SummarizePost`)
   - Analyze the comments (`AnalyzeComments`)
3. Writes a detailed report identifying the key trends across all posts (`GenerateReport`)
4. Edits the report into the style of Paul Graham (`EditReport`)
5. Generates a tweet in the voice of Paul Graham (`WriteTweet`)

## Running the example

```bash
# Navigate to the example directory
cd examples/hacker-news-analyzer

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>

# Run the example
pnpm run dev
```

The workflow will create two files:

- `hn_analysis_report.md`: A detailed analysis report
- `hn_analysis_tweet.txt`: A tweet-sized summary of the analysis

## Key patterns

### Parallel processing

The `AnalyzeHNPosts` component processes each post in parallel and does two types of analysis in parallel as well. This is achieved using `Promise.all` to concurrently process multiple posts, with each post's analysis being handled by separate components.

```ts
const AnalyzeHNPosts = gensx.Component(
  "AnalyzeHNPosts",
  async ({ stories }: AnalyzeHNPostsProps) => {
    const analyses = await Promise.all(
      stories.map(async (story) => {
        const [summary, commentAnalysis] = await Promise.all([
          SummarizePost({ story }),
          AnalyzeComments({
            postId: story.id,
            comments: story.comments,
          }),
        ]);
        return { summary, commentAnalysis };
      }),
    );
    return { analyses };
  },
);
```

The component returns an array of `analyses` that looks like this:

```ts
{
  analyses: [
    { summary: "...", commentAnalysis: "..." },
    { summary: "...", commentAnalysis: "..." },
    // ...
  ];
}
```
