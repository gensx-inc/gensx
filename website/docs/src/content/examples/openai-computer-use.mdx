# OpenAI Computer Use

The [OpenAI Computer Use](https://github.com/gensx-inc/gensx/tree/main/examples/openai-computer-use) example show how to use OpenAI's computer-use model with GenSX to control a web browser with natural language.

## Workflow

The OpenAI Computer Use workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Launch a browser session with Playwright (`<BrowserProvider>`)
2. Send an initial user prompt to the OpenAI computer-use model (`<OpenAIResponses>`)
3. Process any computer actions requested by the model
   - Execute browser actions like clicking, scrolling, typing, etc. (`<UseBrowser>`)
   - Take a screenshot after each action and send it back to the model
4. Optionally collect human feedback and continue the conversation (`<HumanFeedback>`)
5. Process subsequent model responses and browser actions until completion

Here's an example trace of the workflow showing the actions taken at each step:
![OpenAI Computer Use Workflow](/docs/computer-use-trace.png)

## Running the example

From the root of the [GensX Github Repo](https://github.com/gensx-inc/gensx), run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Install playwright
npx playwright install

# Run the example
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key> pnpm start:example openai-computer-use
```

The default prompt is `how long does it take to drive from seattle to portland? use google maps` but you can change this by editing the `index.tsx` file. You can also control whether or not the example is multi-turn by toggling the `allowHumanFeedback` prop. This is set to `false` by default but you might what to change this to `true` so you can continue the conversation with the model in the terminal.

When you run the example, you'll see an output like the following:

```bash
ðŸš€ Starting the computer use example

ðŸŽ¯ PROMPT: how long does it take to drive from seattle to portland? use google maps
ðŸ’» Action: screenshot
ðŸ’» Action: click at (188, 180) with button 'left'
ðŸ’» Action: type text 'Google Maps'
ðŸ’» Action: keypress 'ENTER'
ðŸ’» Action: wait
ðŸ’» Action: click at (233, 230) with button 'left'
ðŸ’» New tab opened
ðŸ’» Action: wait
ðŸ’» Action: click at (389, 38) with button 'left'
ðŸ’» Action: type text 'Seattle to Portland'
ðŸ’» Action: keypress 'ENTER'
ðŸ’» Action: wait
âœ… Computer use complete

âœ¨ Final response: The estimated driving time from Seattle to Portland on Google Maps is approximately 2 hours and 58 minutes via I-5 S, covering a distance of 174 miles. Would you like any more assistance with your route?
```

## Key patterns

### Browser automation

The example uses Playwright to control a web browser, creating a context that's shared throughout the workflow. The `BrowserProvider` component initializes a browser session and makes it available to child components:

```tsx
const BrowserProvider = gensx.Component<BrowserProviderProps, never>(
  "BrowserProvider",
  async ({ initialUrl }) => {
    const browser = await chromium.launch({
      headless: false,
      chromiumSandbox: true,
      env: {},
      args: ["--disable-extensions", "--disable-file-system"],
    });
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1024, height: 768 });
    await page.goto(initialUrl);

    return <BrowserContext.Provider value={{ page }} />;
  },
);
```

### Processing model actions

The `ProcessComputerCalls` component handles the computer actions returned by the model. For each action, it:

1. Extracts the action from the model response
2. Executes the action on the browser using the `UseBrowser` component
3. Takes a screenshot of the result
4. Sends the screenshot back to the model
5. Processes the next model response

```tsx
const ProcessComputerCalls = gensx.Component<
  ProcessComputerCallsProps,
  ProcessComputerCallsResult
>("ProcessComputerCalls", async ({ response }) => {
  let currentResponse = response;
  let computerCalls = currentResponse.output.filter(
    (item) => item.type === "computer_call",
  );

  while (computerCalls.length > 0) {
    // Execute browser action and take screenshot
    // ...
    // Send screenshot back to model
    // ...
    // Get updated response
    // ...
  }

  return { updatedResponse: currentResponse };
});
```

### Interactive feedback loop

The example supports an interactive conversation with the model, allowing you to provide feedback or additional instructions once the model finishes an initial turn:

```tsx
// Start conversation loop with human feedback
let currentResponse = updatedResponse;
let continueConversation = true;

while (continueConversation) {
  // Get human feedback
  const { userMessage, shouldExit } = await HumanFeedback.run({
    assistantMessage: currentResponse.output_text,
  });

  // Exit if requested
  if (shouldExit) {
    continueConversation = false;
    continue;
  }

  // Send user message to model
  // ...
  // Process any computer calls in the response
  // ...
}
```
