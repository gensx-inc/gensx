# Blog writer

Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, discrete steps is one of the best ways to improve the quality of LLM outputs. The [blog writer workflow example](https://github.com/gensx-inc/gensx/tree/main/examples/blogWriter) does this by following the same approach a human would take to write a blog post: first conducting research, then generating a first draft, and finally editing that draft.

## Workflow

The Blog Writer workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Parallel research phase:
   - Brainstorm topics using LLM (`<BrainstormTopics>`)
   - Research each topic in detail (`<ResearchTopic>`)
   - Gather web research (`<SearchWeb>`)
2. Write initial draft based on research (`<WriteDraft>`)
3. Edit and polish the content (`<EditDraft>`)

## Running the example

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>

# Run the example
pnpm run start
```

## Key patterns

### Running components in parallel

The `<Research>` component runs both the `BrainstormTopics` and `SearchWeb` components in parallel. Both sub-workflows return an array of strings which are automatically combined into a single array.

```tsx
const Research = gsx.Component<ResearchComponentProps, ResearchOutput>(
  "Research",
  ({ prompt }) => {
    return (
      <>
        <BrainstormTopics prompt={prompt}>
          {({ topics }) => {
            return topics.map((topic) => <ResearchTopic topic={topic} />);
          }}
        </BrainstormTopics>
        <SearchWeb prompt={prompt} />
      </>
    );
  },
);
```

### Streaming Output

The workflow streams back the final output to reduce the time that it takes for the user to receive the first token. The `<EditDraft>` component is a [`StreamComponent`](/docs/basic-concepts#component-types) and the `<ChatCompletion>` component has `stream={true}`.

```tsx
const EditDraft = gsx.StreamComponent<EditDraftProps>(
  "EditDraft",
  ({ draft }) => {
    return (
      <ChatCompletion
        stream={true}
        model="gpt-4o-mini"
        temperature={0}
        messages={[
          { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
          { role: "user", content: draft },
        ]}
      />
    );
  },
);
```

Then when the component is invoked, `stream={true}` is passed to the component so that the output is streamed back and can be surfaced to the user:

```tsx
<EditDraft draft={draft} stream={true} />
```
