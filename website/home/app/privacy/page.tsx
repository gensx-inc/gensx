      one of these CCPA exceptions, we may deny your request to correct such
      data. ‍Processing of Sensitive Personal Information Opt-Out ‍Consumers
      have certain rights over the processing of their sensitive information.
      However, we do not intentionally collect sensitive categories of personal

      under CCPA To exercise the rights described in this Privacy Policy, you
      or, if you are a California resident, your Authorized Agent (as defined
      below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to
      allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected
      Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to
      allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it ( a “Valid Request”).
      We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will
      only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity
      and complete your request. We will work to respond to any Valid Request
      within the time period required by applicable law. We will not charge you
      a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is
      excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your
      Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain
      that decision before completing your request. You may submit a Valid
      Request using the following methods by emailing us at: contact@GenSX.com.

      “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. ‍We Will Not
