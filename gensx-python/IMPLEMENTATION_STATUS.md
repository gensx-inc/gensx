- [x] Created core modules: `component.py`, `workflow.py`, `context.py`, `types.py`, `exceptions.py`
- [x] Set up utils module with `wrap.py`
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite

### ✅ Core Component Implementation

- [x] `Component` decorator/wrapper function
- [x] Support for both sync and async functions
- [x] Component options (metadata, secret handling, etc.)
- [x] Functional and decorator style usage
- [x] Error handling and serialization
- [x] Component execution tracking

### ✅ Workflow Implementation

- [x] `Workflow` decorator/wrapper function
- [x] Workflow execution context management
- [x] Checkpoint manager integration
- [x] Error handling and metadata support
- [x] `.run()` method for convenience

### ✅ Context Management

- [x] `ExecutionContext` for hierarchical context
- [x] `WorkflowContext` for shared workflow state
- [x] `CheckpointManager` for execution tracking
- [x] Context variables for thread-safe execution
- [x] Auto-initialization for standalone component usage
- [x] `create_context()` and `use_context()` functions

### ✅ SDK Wrapping

- [x] `wrap()` function for automatic SDK wrapping
- [x] Proxy pattern for method interception
- [x] Support for nested objects and methods
- [x] Component name generation from object paths
- [x] Prefix support and replacement implementations
- [x] Preservation of non-callable attributes

### ✅ Type Safety & Error Handling

- [x] Strong typing with TypeVar and Protocols
- [x] Custom exception classes
- [x] Runtime type checking
- [x] Error serialization for checkpointing

### ✅ Testing & Examples

- [x] Comprehensive test suite (24 tests, all passing)
- [x] Component functionality tests
- [x] Workflow execution tests
- [x] SDK wrapping tests
- [x] Basic usage examples
- [x] SDK wrapping examples

## Key Features Implemented

### Component System

```python
@Component("MyComponent")
async def my_component(props: dict) -> str:
    return f"Hello {props['name']}"

# Or functional style
my_component = Component("MyComponent", my_function)
```

### Workflow Orchestration

```python
@Workflow("MyWorkflow")
async def my_workflow(props: dict) -> str:
    result = await my_component(props)
    return result

# Execute workflow
result = await my_workflow.run({"name": "World"})
```

### SDK Wrapping

```python
# Wrap any SDK/class
wrapped_sdk = wrap(my_sdk)

# Methods become GenSX components automatically
result = await wrapped_sdk.some_method({"param": "value"})
```

### Context Management

```python
# Create and use contexts
my_context = create_context("default_value")
value = use_context(my_context)
```

## What's Working

1. **✅ Component Creation**: Both decorator and functional styles
2. **✅ Workflow Execution**: Full workflow orchestration with checkpointing
3. **✅ Async Support**: Native async/await support throughout
4. **✅ SDK Integration**: Automatic wrapping of external SDKs
5. **✅ Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and serialization
6. **✅ Type Safety**: Strong typing with runtime validation
7. **✅ Context Management**: Hierarchical context with inheritance
8. **✅ Execution Tracking**: Checkpoint-based execution tracking

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

- [ ] Enhanced streaming support with AsyncIterators
- [ ] Parallel execution with dependency resolution
- [ ] Advanced context providers and consumers
- [ ] Performance optimizations

### Phase 3: Production Features

- [ ] Enhanced checkpointing with persistence
- [ ] Debugging and visualization tools
- [ ] Integration with GenSX Cloud
- [ ] Advanced error recovery

### Phase 4: Developer Experience

- [ ] Enhanced documentation
- [ ] More examples and tutorials
- [ ] IDE integration and tooling
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## API Compatibility with TypeScript GenSX

The Python implementation maintains API compatibility with the core concepts of the TypeScript version:

- **Components**: Similar decorator pattern and execution model
- **Workflows**: Same concept of top-level execution wrappers
- **Context**: Similar to React Context API
- **SDK Wrapping**: Automatic conversion of methods to components
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error serialization and handling

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run examples
python examples/basic_example.py
python examples/wrap_example.py
```

## Summary

Phase 1 has been successfully completed with a fully functional GenSX Python implementation that includes:

- ✅ Core component and workflow system
- ✅ Context management and execution tracking
- ✅ SDK wrapping functionality
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Working examples and documentation

The implementation is ready for real-world usage and provides a solid foundation for building LLM workflows in Python with the same developer experience as the TypeScript version.
