# GenSX CLI

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g gensx

# or

pnpm install -g gensx

# or

yarn global add gensx

# or

brew install gensx-inc/gensx/gensx
```

Or use without installing globally:

```bash
npx gensx
```

## Usage

### Login

Login to GenSX to get started:

```bash
gensx login
```

Now you will have an API key saved in your config file, and this will be used by default for any commands that require authentication, or when running a workflow locally.
