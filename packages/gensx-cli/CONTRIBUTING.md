# GenSX CLI

## Development

1. Install deps:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Build the CLI:

```bash
pnpm build
```

3. Install the CLI globally:

```bash
pnpm link --global
```

4. Watch for changes:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Now you can call `gensx` from the command line anywhere, and it will run the CLI with your most recent changes.
