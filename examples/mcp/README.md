## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. MCP allows AI assistants to access relevant context from various systems where data lives, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments.

This example demonstrates how to create components that connect to and interact with MCP servers.
