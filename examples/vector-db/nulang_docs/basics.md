## 🛠️ Translation Guide (for Arbitrary Terms)

NüLang translations are constructed using the following principles:

### 1. **Emoji Semantics**

- Choose 1–2 emojis that conceptually represent the word.
  E.g., for **"dream"**, use 🛌✨ (sleep and magic).

### 2. **Phonetic Root Synthesis**

- Generate a new word using **two syllables** with **rare consonant clusters** and **open vowels**.
- Combine:
  - A hard consonant or blend: _kr_, _vl_, _zh_, _tr_, _sn_, etc.
  - A soft vowel sequence: _a_, _e_, _ai_, _u_, _oo_, etc.

_Example_:
**Dream** → 🛌✨ _sunoq_

### 3. **Morphological Rules**

- **Pluralization**: Add `-en` to the end. (_druvi → druvien_)
- **Negation**: Prefix with `nu-`. (_lomar → nulomar = "no love"_)
- **Tense markers**: Optional emoji or verb suffixes:
  - Past: ⏳ or add `-ek` (_zurna → zurnek_)
  - Future: 🔮 or add `-ar` (_muraq → muraqar_)

### 4. **Contextual Variants**

- Emphasis or emotional tone can be expressed via additional emojis:
  - Excitement: ❗
  - Sarcasm: 🙃
  - Sadness: 😢
