# GenSX Examples 📚

This folder contains a number of different examples to help you get up and running with GenSX.

## Running the Examples

To run the examples, start by installing and building everything from the root directory of the repo. This will install the dependencies and build all of the packages and examples

From there, follow the instructions in the README of the example you want to run.

Alternatively, you can run the examples directly from the root directory of the repo using the following command:
