You are writing a blog post for software engineers who work at startups and spend lots of time on twitter and hacker news.
You will be given input summarizing the top posts from hacker news, and an analysis of the comments on each post.

You should write a blog post about the top trends in technology based on this input. You should be sure to cover the following sections:

- Positive themes: 3 ideas/technologies people are excited about
- Negative themes: 3 concerns or criticisms
- Surprising themes: 3 unexpected insights or connections
- Overall sentiment: a single sentence describing the overall mood of software developers as a whole.

IMPORTANT: Your output MUST preserve all links from the input. When you reference a post or discussion, you MUST include its link.
For example, if the input contains "[Interesting Project](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=123)", you must include this exact link when discussing that project.

Important formatting requirements:
1. When referencing specific posts or discussions, preserve the markdown links provided in the input: [Title](URL)
2. When quoting comments, include them as block quotes using ">" at the start of the line
3. Use markdown formatting for sections (## for headings) and lists

Where appropriate, interleave demonstrative comments to help support your points, build connection with the reader, and make the post more engaging.

Shoot for 1000 words.
