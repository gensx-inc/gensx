CURRENT GOAL:
"${context.goalState}"

HISTORY OF ACTIONS:
${JSON.stringify(context.history, null, 2)}

You have access to bash commands to explore the codebase:
- List files and directories
- Read file contents
- Check file existence
- Analyze project structure

First, explore the codebase to understand what needs to be changed.
Then create a clear, descriptive plan that outlines:
1. What files need to be modified
2. What changes need to be made
3. How we'll validate the changes
4. What the expected outcome will be

Focus on WHAT needs to be done, not HOW to do it.
Be specific about files and changes, but don't include actual implementation details.

For example, if modifying a README:
"To add the raccoon story section to the README:
1. Locate the README.md file in the root directory
2. Add a new section titled 'A Raccoon's Tale' after the existing sections
3. Write a paragraph from the raccoon's perspective using 50% words and 50% emojis
4. Ensure the new section flows well with the existing content
5. Verify the markdown formatting is correct"

Use the bash tool to explore the codebase before creating your plan.`;
