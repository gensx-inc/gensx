  "goalState": "The codebase consists of various TypeScript files, a configuration for ESLint, a TypeScript configuration, a package.json, and a README. There are directories for agents and tools, and there's a distribution directory (`dist`) with compiled JavaScript files.\n\nGiven this structure, here is a potential new goal:\n\n**Goal**: Enhance Code Quality with Linting\n\n**Objective**: Improve the code quality by integrating a linting step in the build process and ensuring the codebase adheres to a consistent style guide.\n\n**Actionable Steps**:\n1. **Review and Update ESLint Configuration**: Ensure that the `.eslintrc` configuration file (`eslint.config.mjs`) is set up with desired rules and plugins.\n2. **Integrate Linting in Build Process**: Modify the `package.json` scripts to include a linting step that runs ESLint on the entire codebase.\n3. **Fix Existing Linting Errors**: Run the linter and fix any existing linting errors or warnings across the codebase to ensure compliance with the style guide.\n4. **Automate Linting Checks**: Consider setting up pre-commit hooks using Husky or a similar tool to ensure that code is linted before being committed.\n\nThis goal will help maintain code quality and consistency across the project. Would you like to proceed with this goal or explore a different aspect of the codebase?",

      "details": "Based on the exploration, we can see that there's a README.md file in the root directory of the project. This is the file that will need to be modified to achieve the current goal. Here's a plan:\n\n1. Locate the README.md file in the root directory.\n\n2. Identify the appropriate section to add the new 'A Raccoon's Tale' story. If there is no specific section for stories, we can add it at the end of the file.\n\n3. Write a paragraph from the raccoon's perspective using 50% words and 50% emojis. Be sure to create a unique and engaging narrative that fits within the context of the project.\n\n4. Make sure that the new story flows well with the rest of the content in the README.md file. It should not disrupt or contradict any existing information.\n\n5. Use Markdown syntax to format the new section. This will ensure that the content is displayed correctly when the README.md file is viewed on platforms that support Markdown rendering, such as GitHub.\n\n6. After the changes have been made, view the updated README.md file in a Markdown viewer to make sure that the formatting is correct. If any issues are identified, fix them and then recheck the file.\n\n7. Finally, commit the changes and push them to the project's repository. The updated README.md file should now be visible to all members of the project.\n\nThis plan focuses on what needs to be done to achieve the current goal. The specific details of how to implement these steps will depend on the tools and technologies that are being used."

      "details": "Based on the exploration, here is a plan to achieve the current goal:\n\n1. **Review and Update ESLint Configuration**\n    - File: `eslint.config.mjs`\n    - Changes: Review the current configuration and rules. Update or add new rules and plugins as needed. The configuration should be set to enforce a consistent coding style and prevent potential bugs.\n\n2. **Integrate Linting in Build Process**\n    - File: `package.json`\n    - Changes: Modify the `scripts` section to include a linting step that runs before the build process. For example, the `build` script could be modified to `\"build\": \"npm run lint && tsc\"`. This ensures that the codebase is linted every time a build is triggered.\n\n3. **Fix Existing Linting Errors**\n    - Files: All TypeScript files in the codebase\n    - Changes: Run the linter by executing `npm run lint` and fix any linting errors or warnings that are reported. This could involve changes in multiple files across the codebase.\n\n4. **Automate Linting Checks**\n    - File: `package.json`\n    - Changes: Install Husky or a similar tool and configure it to automatically run the linter before each commit. This can be done by adding a `precommit` script in the `scripts` section, like `\"precommit\": \"npm run lint\"`. \n\n5. **Validation**\n    - Run the build process by executing `npm run build` to ensure that the linting step is working correctly.\n    - Commit some changes and verify that the pre-commit hook is triggered and that it runs the linter.\n\n6. **Expected Outcome**\n    - The ESLint configuration is updated with the desired rules and plugins.\n    - The linting step is integrated into the build process.\n    - All existing linting errors or warnings are fixed.\n    - Automated linting checks are set up for each commit.\n    - The overall code quality and consistency are improved.\n\nThis plan focuses on what needs to be done to achieve the current goal.
