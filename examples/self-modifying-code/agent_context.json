      "action": "Attempted code modifications",
      "result": "success",
      "details": "The code modification involved several key updates across multiple files. A new file, `utils.tsx`, was created to centralize common utilities such as command execution, logging, and error handling. This change led to updates in `bashTool.tsx`, `editTool.tsx`, and `buildTool.tsx` to leverage the new utilities. Enhanced logging and error handling were integrated into multiple files, including `generatePlan.tsx`. A testing environment was established using Jest, with a dedicated `tests` directory and initial tests for utility functions. Documentation was improved with an updated `README.md` that now includes architecture and testing instructions. Finally, the build completed successfully, and tests were confirmed to run correctly, ensuring all changes were validated."
