This story should be a paragraph, and written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. This raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.",

      "details": "Based on the output from the bash command, we have a README.md file in the root directory that we need to update. Here is a plan to achieve the goal:\n\n1. Locate the README.md file in the root directory. This is the file that needs to be updated.\n\n2. Add a new section in the README.md file. This section should be titled 'A Day in the Life of an Infrastructure Engineer Raccoon'. It should be positioned after the existing sections in the README.md file.\n\n3. In this new section, write a paragraph from the perspective of a raccoon who is an infrastructure engineer. This raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis. This will require creativity and a balance between words and emojis to effectively convey the story.\n\n4. Ensure that the new section flows well with the existing content. This means the story should not disrupt the continuity of the existing content and should rather add to it or enhance it.\n\n5. Validate the changes by checking the markdown formatting. The new section should follow the markdown syntax properly and the use of emojis should not break the formatting.\n\n6. The expected outcome is a README.md file with a new section that tells an engaging and unique story from the perspective of a raccoon infrastructure engineer, using a balanced mix of words and emojis."
