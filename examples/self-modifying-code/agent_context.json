  "goalState": "Based on the current state of the codebase, here is a proposed new goal:\n\n### New Goal: Enhance Code Quality by Implementing ESLint and Prettier Configuration\n\n**Objective:** Improve the code quality and maintainability by configuring ESLint and Prettier to enforce consistent coding styles and catch potential issues early in the development process.\n\n**Steps to Achieve:**\n\n1. **Configure ESLint:**\n   - Review the existing `eslint.config.mjs` file to ensure it is set up with a comprehensive set of rules.\n   - Update the configuration to include recommended rules for the project's tech stack (e.g., TypeScript, Node.js).\n   - Add plugins and extensions that are relevant to the project structure and dependencies, such as `eslint-plugin-node` or `eslint-plugin-import`.\n\n2. **Integrate Prettier:**\n   - Install `prettier` as a dependency if not already included.\n   - Create a `.prettierrc` configuration file to define code formatting rules.\n   - Ensure that ESLint and Prettier work together without conflicts by using `eslint-plugin-prettier` and `eslint-config-prettier`.\n\n3. **Update Scripts:**\n   - Add a new script in `package.json` for running Prettier, e.g., `\"format\": \"prettier --write .\"`\n   - Ensure `lint` and `format` scripts are easy to use and run efficiently in the development workflow.\n\n4. **Validate Configuration:**\n   - Run the `lint` and `format` scripts to ensure there are no errors and all files adhere to the specified coding standards.\n   - Address any issues or inconsistencies identified during the validation process.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n- The codebase will have a standardized style guide enforced by ESLint and Prettier.\n- Developers will have tools to automatically format code and catch potential issues, leading to improved code quality and consistency across the project.\n\nWould you like to proceed with this goal or suggest any modifications?",

Files to be modified: `README.md` in the root directory.\n\n2. Changes to be made:\n   - A new section needs to be added to the README file. \n   - This section should have a title, for instance, 'A Raccoon's Life.' \n   - Under this section, a paragraph needs to be written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. \n   - The paragraph must be composed of 50% words and 50% emojis, as per the raccoon's speech limitation.\n\n3. Validate the changes:\n   - After the changes are made, the README.md file needs to be opened to review the new section.\n   - Ensure that the new section is well-integrated with the existing content, and the markdown formatting is correct.\n   - The balance of words and emojis in the paragraph should be confirmed to be 50/50.\n\n4. Expected outcome:\n   - The README.md file will have a new section titled 'A Raccoon's Life.'\n   - This section will contain a paragraph from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a raccoon, with the text being a combination of words and emojis in equal measure."
