  "goalState": "Let's start with a simple change and build confidence from there. Let's update the README to add a new section the README. This story should be a paragraph, and written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. This raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.",

      "details": "Plan to achieve the current goal:\n\n1. Locate the file to be modified:\n   - The file to modify is the README.md file located in the root directory of the project.\n\n2. Changes to be made:\n   - We need to add a new section titled 'A Raccoon's Tale' at the end of the existing sections in the README.md file.\n   - In this section, we will write a paragraph narrated by the raccoon. The raccoon's speech will be unique, incorporating 50% words and 50% emojis. The challenge will be to craft a story that is not only understandable but also engaging with this unique constraint.\n\n3. Validation of the changes:\n   - After making the changes, we will open the README.md file in a Markdown viewer. This will allow us to visually verify that the formatting is correct, and that the emojis are displayed properly.\n\n4. Expected outcome:\n   - The README.md file will have an additional section titled 'A Raccoon's Tale' where a story is narrated by the raccoon using 50% words and 50% emojis. This story will be understandable and engaging despite the unique constraint of the raccoon's speech pattern. The section will fit seamlessly into the overall structure of the README.md file, and all formatting will display as intended."
