      "details": "Based on the exploration of the codebase, I can now create a plan to achieve the goal of improving the agent's capabilities for making changes more rapidly and consistently.\n\n# Plan to Improve Agent Capabilities\n\n## 1. Create a Caching System for File Operations\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/cacheManager.tsx`\n- Modify: `agent/tools/editTool.tsx`\n- Modify: `agent/tools/bashTool.tsx`\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Create a caching system that stores file contents in memory to reduce redundant file system operations\n2. Add cache invalidation logic for when files are modified\n3. Integrate cache with both the edit and bash tools to speed up operations\n4. Implement methods to pre-fetch commonly accessed files\n\n**Validation approach:**\n- Verify the cache correctly stores and retrieves file contents\n- Confirm cache invalidation works when files are modified\n- Test performance improvements with multiple file operations\n\n## 2. Implement Intelligent Code Analysis\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/codeAnalyzer.tsx`\n- Modify: `agent/codeAgent.tsx`\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Create a code analyzer tool that can parse and understand TypeScript/JavaScript code structure\n2. Add functionality to identify related files when making changes\n3. Implement pattern recognition for common code structures\n4. Add ability to suggest related files that might need updating when a change is made\n\n**Validation approach:**\n- Test the analyzer with different code files\n- Verify it correctly identifies related components and dependencies\n- Confirm suggestions are relevant and helpful\n\n## 3. Add Automated Testing Capabilities\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/testRunner.tsx`\n- Modify: `agent/smcAgent.tsx`\n- Modify: `workspace.tsx`\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Create a test runner tool that can execute tests for modified files\n2. Add functionality to automatically identify which tests should be run for specific changes\n3. Implement validation steps before committing changes\n4. Integrate test results into the decision-making process\n\n**Validation approach:**\n- Verify tests run correctly for modified files\n- Confirm the agent can interpret test results\n- Test the entire workflow from modification to validation\n\n## 4. Improve Error Handling and Recovery\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Modify: `agent/codeAgent.tsx`\n- Modify: `agent/smcAgent.tsx`\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/errorAnalyzer.tsx`\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Enhance error handling with more detailed error analysis\n2. Add ability to automatically fix common errors\n3. Implement a retry mechanism with different strategies\n4. Create an error analyzer that can suggest fixes based on error patterns\n\n**Validation approach:**\n- Test with deliberately introduced errors\n- Verify the agent can recover from common errors\n- Confirm suggested fixes are appropriate\n\n## 5. Implement Change Templates for Common Operations\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/changeTemplates.tsx`\n- Modify: `agent/steps/generatePlan.tsx`\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Create a library of reusable change templates for common operations\n2. Add functionality to apply templates with customization\n3. Implement a system to learn from successful changes and create new templates\n4. Integrate templates into the planning process\n\n**Validation approach:**\n- Test applying templates to different scenarios\n- Verify templates are correctly customized for specific changes\n- Confirm the template learning system works correctly\n\n## Expected Outcome\n\nAfter implementing these changes, the agent should:\n1. Operate significantly faster due to reduced redundant file operations\n2. Make more consistent changes through better code understanding\n3. Have better error recovery capabilities\n4. Produce higher quality changes with fewer mistakes\n5. Learn from past operations to continuously improve\n\nThe ultimate goal is to create a self-improving system that gets better with each iteration, making changes to its own source code quickly and reliably."
