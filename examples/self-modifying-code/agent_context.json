  "goalState": "Based on the exploration of the codebase, here's a proposed goal:\n\n**Goal: Improve Code Quality by Enforcing Consistent Code Style**\n\n### Objective:\nImplement and configure a code style enforcement tool to ensure consistent styling across the codebase. This will help maintain clean and readable code, making it easier for developers to collaborate and contribute.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Integrate Prettier**:\n   - Install Prettier as a development dependency.\n   - Create a `.prettierrc` configuration file with preferred styling rules.\n   - Add a script to the `package.json` to format code using Prettier.\n\n2. **Update ESLint Configuration**:\n   - Ensure ESLint is configured to work with Prettier by installing `eslint-config-prettier`.\n   - Update the `eslint.config.mjs` file to extend `prettier` configuration, disabling any conflicting rules.\n\n3. **Verify Integration**:\n   - Run Prettier and ESLint across the codebase to ensure all files adhere to the new styling rules.\n   - Make any necessary code adjustments for compliance.\n\n4. **Documentation**:\n   - Update the README to include instructions on using the new formatting tools.\n\n### Benefits:\n- Ensures consistent code formatting, reducing stylistic debates during code reviews.\n- Simplifies the onboarding process for new developers by providing clear style guidelines.\n- Enhances code readability and maintainability.\n\nWould you like to proceed with this goal, or would you prefer to explore another aspect of the codebase?",

This is the file we will need to modify in order to achieve the current goal. \n\nHere is a plan for the modification:\n\n1. Locate the README.md file in the root directory. \n\n2. Add a new section to the README.md file. This section should be titled 'A Raccoon's Tale' and it should be placed at the end of the existing content. \n\n3. Write a paragraph in this new section from the perspective of an 'infrastructure engineer raccoon' who speaks in 50% words and 50% emojis. \n\n4. Ensure that the new section integrates well with the existing content and doesn't disrupt the flow of the README file. \n\n5. After the changes are made, verify the markdown formatting is correct. This can be done by previewing the README.md file in a Markdown viewer to ensure that all the formatting (including emojis) is displayed correctly. \n\n6. Save the changes to the README.md file. \n\nExpected Outcome:\nAfter the changes, the README.md file should have an additional section titled 'A Raccoon's Tale' that contains a paragraph from the perspective of an 'infrastructure engineer raccoon' using 50% words and 50% emojis. All formatting should be correct and the new section should fit well into the existing content."

Ensure all files adhere to the new styling rules.\n   - Run ESLint across the codebase to ensure all files are compliant.\n\n4. **Documentation**:\n   - Update the `README.md` file to include instructions on using the new formatting tools.\n\nThe expected outcome is that the codebase will be uniformly formatted according to the rules specified in `.prettierrc` and `eslint.config.mjs`. The `README.md` file will provide clear instructions on how to use these tools. This will ensure code consistency and readability, making it easier for developers to understand and contribute to the project."
