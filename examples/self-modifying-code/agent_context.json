This story should be a paragraph, and written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. This raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.",

      "details": "Plan to add a new section \"A Raccoon's Tale\" to the README:\n\n1. Locate the README.md file in the root directory. This is the file that needs to be modified.\n2. Add a new section titled 'A Raccoon's Tale' after the \"Killing all agents\" section. This will be our new section where we will add the story.\n3. Write a paragraph from the raccoon's perspective using 50% words and 50% emojis. The story will be about an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. Bear in mind the raccoon's speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.\n4. Ensure the new section flows well with the existing content. The story should be coherent and well-integrated with the rest of the README.\n5. Verify the markdown formatting is correct. Markdown is the formatting language used in README files, and it needs to be properly used to ensure the README is displayed correctly on platforms like GitHub.\n6. Check that the text and emojis are evenly split in the new section. This is to adhere to the raccoon's speech limitation as mentioned in the goal.\n7. Save the changes and view the README.md file to ensure the new section is added and displays as expected.\n\nExpected Outcome:\n\nThe README.md file will have a new section titled 'A Raccoon's Tale' which contains a paragraph written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. The paragraph will be a mix of words and emojis, with each making up 50% of the content. The new section will flow well with the existing content and the markdown formatting will be correct."
