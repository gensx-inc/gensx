  "goalState": "Based on the structure of the codebase, here's a brief overview:\n\n- The root directory contains configuration files and typescript source files such as `index.tsx`, `lease.ts`, `workspace.tsx`, and several JSON configuration files like `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `nodemon.json`.\n- There is a `README.md` file which was recently updated.\n- The `agent` directory contains files related to agents, such as `codeAgent.tsx` and `smcAgent.tsx`, along with a `tools` subdirectory containing various tool-related TypeScript files.\n- The `node_modules` directory contains dependencies, indicating the use of npm or a similar package manager for managing project dependencies.\n\n### Proposed New Goal\n\n**Goal**: Improve TypeScript Configuration for Better Development Experience\n\n**Objective**: Enhance the TypeScript setup to improve error checking and code quality during development.\n\n### Action Plan\n\n1. **Review `tsconfig.json`**: Check the current TypeScript configuration for potential improvements. This includes ensuring strict type checking is enabled and other useful compiler options are utilized.\n\n2. **Enable Strict Mode**: If not already enabled, turn on strict mode in `tsconfig.json` by setting `strict` to `true`. This enforces stricter type checking, which can catch potential errors earlier.\n\n3. **Add Useful Compiler Options**: Consider adding the following options for a better development experience:\n   - `noImplicitAny`: Raise errors on expressions and declarations with an implied `any` type.\n   - `strictNullChecks`: Ensure `null` and `undefined` are handled explicitly.\n   - `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`: Help identify and remove unused code.\n\n4. **Validate Changes**: Make sure the codebase compiles successfully with the new TypeScript settings and fix any issues that arise.\n\n5. **Document Changes**: Update the `README.md` or other relevant documentation to reflect the new TypeScript settings and their benefits.\n\nWould you like to proceed with this goal?",

      "details": "Based on the codebase exploration, we can see that there's a README.md file in the root directory. This is the file we need to modify to accomplish the goal.\n\nHere is the plan:\n\n1. Locate the README.md file in the root directory. This is the file that needs to be altered.\n\n2. Append a new section to README.md named 'From the Perspective of a Trash-Eating Raccoon'. This section should be located at the end of the current sections.\n\n3. In this section, tell a story from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. The raccoon has a limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis. This will require careful word selection and creative use of emojis to convey meaning.\n\n4. Ensure that the new section fits well with the existing content and doesn't disrupt the overall flow of the README.md. The story should be engaging, entertaining, and informative. \n\n5. Validate the changes by reviewing the updated README.md file. Confirm that the markdown formatting is correct and the new section is rendered properly. Also, check that the story meets the requirement of being 50% words and 50% emojis.\n\n6. The expected outcome is an updated README.md file with a new section telling a story from a unique perspective. It should add a touch of humor and creativity to the file, while still providing meaningful content."

However, options such as `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `noUnusedLocals`, and `noUnusedParameters` are not explicitly set.

Check if the compilation is successful and if there are any new TypeScript errors.\n   - If any new TypeScript errors arise due to these stricter rules, they will need to be resolved.\n\n4. **Expected outcome**: Enhanced TypeScript configuration that provides better error checking and improves code quality during development. These changes will help catch potential errors earlier and make the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.\n\n5. **Document Changes**: Update the `README.md` file to reflect the new TypeScript settings and their benefits. Explain why these settings were added and how they improve the development process. This can be done under a new section titled \"TypeScript Configuration\". Ensure the new section fits well with the existing content and doesn't disrupt the overall flow of the README.md. \n\nTo proceed with this plan, we need you to confirm or provide us with the build command for this project to validate the changes."
