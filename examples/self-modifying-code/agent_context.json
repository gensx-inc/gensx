  "goalState": "Based on the structure of the codebase, here's a brief overview:\n\n- The root directory contains configuration files and TypeScript source files such as `index.tsx`, `lease.ts`, `workspace.tsx`, and several JSON configuration files like `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `nodemon.json`.\n- The `agent` directory contains files related to agents, such as `codeAgent.tsx` and `smcAgent.tsx`, along with a `tools` subdirectory containing various tool-related TypeScript files.\n- The `node_modules` directory contains dependencies, indicating the use of npm or a similar package manager for managing project dependencies.\n\n### Proposed New Goal\n\n**Goal**: Implement and Enforce Coding Standards with ESLint\n\n**Objective**: Enhance code quality and maintainability by implementing a comprehensive ESLint configuration tailored to the project's needs.\n\n### Action Plan\n\n1. **Review Current ESLint Configuration**: Examine the existing `eslint.config.mjs` file to understand the current linting rules and identify areas for improvement.\n\n2. **Update ESLint Rules**: Adjust the ESLint configuration to include additional rules that promote code quality, such as:\n   - Enforcing consistent coding styles (e.g., indentation, quotes, semi-colons).\n   - Identifying common coding errors and potential bugs.\n   - Encouraging best practices and modern JavaScript/TypeScript usage.\n\n3. **Integrate Prettier**: Consider integrating Prettier with ESLint to ensure consistent code formatting across the codebase.\n\n4. **Validate Changes**: Run ESLint against the entire codebase to identify any violations. Fix any issues that arise to ensure the code adheres to the new standards.\n\n5. **Document ESLint Configuration**: Update the `README.md` or create a new `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to document the linting rules and provide guidelines for contributors.\n\nWould you like to proceed with this goal?",

This is the file we need to modify to accomplish the goal.\n\nHere is the plan:\n\n1. Locate the README.md file in the root directory. This is the file that needs to be altered.\n\n2. Append a new section to README.md named 'From the Perspective of a Trash-Eating Raccoon'. This section should be located at the end of the current sections.\n\n3. In this section, tell a story from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. The raccoon has a limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis. This will require careful word selection and creative use of emojis to convey meaning.\n\n4. Ensure that the new section fits well with the existing content and doesn't disrupt the overall flow of the README.md. The story should be engaging, entertaining, and informative. \n\n5. Validate the changes by reviewing the updated README.md file. Confirm that the markdown formatting is correct and the new section is rendered properly. Also, check that the story meets the requirement of being 50% words and 50% emojis.\n\n6. The expected outcome is an updated README.md file with a new section telling a story from a unique perspective. It should add a touch of humor and creativity to the file, while still providing meaningful content."

However, options such as `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `noUnusedLocals`, and `noUnusedParameters` are not explicitly set. Here is the plan to achieve the goal:\n\n1. **File to be modified**: `tsconfig.json` located in the root directory.\n\n2. **Changes to be made**:\n   - Set `noImplicitAny` to `true` to raise errors on expressions and declarations with an implied `any` type.\n   - Set `strictNullChecks` to `true` to ensure `null` and `undefined` are handled explicitly.\n   - Set `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` to `true` to help identify and remove unused code.\n\n3. **Validation of changes**:\n   - After making these changes, run the build process using the command appropriate for the project (like `tsc --build`, `npx tsc`, etc.). Check if the compilation is successful and if there are any new TypeScript errors.\n   - If any new TypeScript errors arise due to these stricter rules, they will need to be resolved.\n\n4. **Expected outcome**: Enhanced TypeScript configuration that provides better error checking and improves code quality during development. These changes will help catch potential errors earlier and make the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.\n\n5. **Document Changes**: Update the `README.md` file to reflect the new TypeScript settings and their benefits. Explain why these settings were added and how they improve the development process. This can be done under a new section titled \"TypeScript Configuration\". Ensure the new section fits well with the existing content and doesn't disrupt the overall flow of the README.md. \n\nTo proceed with this plan, we need you to confirm or provide us with the build command for this project to validate the changes."

We need to review its contents to understand the existing linting rules and identify areas that could benefit from stricter enforcement or additional rules.\n\n2. **Update ESLint Rules**: Depending on the findings from the review, we will need to modify `eslint.config.mjs` to enforce stricter code quality standards. This could involve adding or modifying rules related to:\n   - Coding style consistency (e.g., indentation, quotes, semi-colons)\n   - Common coding errors and potential bugs\n   - Best practices and modern JavaScript/TypeScript usage\n\n3. **Integrate Prettier**: To ensure consistency in code formatting, we should consider integrating Prettier with ESLint. This would involve installing Prettier as a dev dependency, and adding a `.prettierrc` file to the root directory with the desired Prettier configuration. We would also need to update the ESLint configuration to turn off rules that conflict with Prettier.\n\n4. **Validate Changes**: To validate the changes, we can run `eslint --fix .` in the root directory. This will run ESLint on all relevant files in the project, and automatically fix any rule violations where possible. Any remaining issues will be reported in the console, and we will need to manually fix these issues to ensure the codebase adheres to the new standards.\n\n5. **Document ESLint Configuration**: Finally, we will update the `README.md` file in the root directory to document the new ESLint and Prettier configurations. This should include a brief explanation of the rules and standards being enforced, and instructions for contributors on how to run ESLint and Prettier on their code.\n\nTo proceed, we would need to know if there are any specific ESLint rules or Prettier settings you would like us to implement."
