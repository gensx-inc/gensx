      "details": "Based on my exploration of the codebase, I can now create a plan to improve the AI agent's capabilities to make changes more rapidly and consistently. Here's my plan:\n\n# Plan to Improve Agent Self-Modification Capabilities\n\n## 1. Create a Caching System for File Contents\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create a new file: `agent/tools/cacheManager.tsx`\n- Modify: `agent/tools/editTool.tsx`\n- Modify: `agent/tools/bashTool.tsx`\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Implement a caching system that stores file contents in memory after they're read\n2. Add cache invalidation when files are modified\n3. Update the editTool to use the cache for file reads\n4. Update the bashTool to invalidate cache when file system commands are executed\n\n**Validation:**\n- Verify the cache correctly stores and retrieves file contents\n- Ensure cache is properly invalidated when files change\n- Measure performance improvement in file access operations\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- Reduced redundant file system operations\n- Faster file access during the agent's exploration phase\n- More consistent file state management\n\n## 2. Add Incremental File Editing Capability\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Modify: `agent/tools/editTool.tsx`\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Add a new `edit` command to the editTool that allows for partial file edits\n2. Implement functionality to replace specific line ranges in a file\n3. Add functionality to insert content at specific positions\n4. Add functionality to delete specific line ranges\n\n**Validation:**\n- Test the edit command with various scenarios (replace, insert, delete)\n- Verify file integrity after partial edits\n- Ensure proper error handling for invalid edit operations\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- More precise and efficient code modifications\n- Reduced risk of unintended changes\n- Better handling of large files\n\n## 3. Implement Better Error Handling and Recovery\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Modify: `agent/codeAgent.tsx`\n- Modify: `agent/smcAgent.tsx`\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Add more robust error handling for file operations\n2. Implement automatic retry logic for common failures\n3. Add detailed error reporting to help diagnose issues\n4. Create a recovery mechanism to revert changes if build fails\n\n**Validation:**\n- Test error handling by introducing intentional errors\n- Verify recovery mechanisms work as expected\n- Ensure detailed error information is captured in the agent context\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- More resilient code modification process\n- Better error diagnostics\n- Reduced failure rate\n\n## 4. Create a Code Analysis Utility\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create a new file: `agent/tools/codeAnalyzer.tsx`\n- Modify: `agent/codeAgent.tsx` to use the analyzer\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Implement a tool that can analyze code structure (functions, classes, imports)\n2. Add functionality to identify dependencies between files\n3. Create methods to locate where specific functions/variables are defined\n4. Add functionality to suggest safe insertion points for new code\n\n**Validation:**\n- Test the analyzer with different file types and code structures\n- Verify accuracy of code structure analysis\n- Ensure the analyzer provides useful information for the agent\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- Better understanding of code relationships\n- More intelligent code modification decisions\n- Reduced risk of breaking changes\n\n## 5. Improve Plan Generation with Templates\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Modify: `agent/steps/generatePlan.tsx`\n- Create a new file: `agent/steps/planTemplates.tsx`\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Create a library of plan templates for common modification patterns\n2. Implement a mechanism to select appropriate templates based on the goal\n3. Add structured planning that breaks complex goals into smaller steps\n4. Improve plan validation to catch potential issues before execution\n\n**Validation:**\n- Test plan generation with various goals\n- Verify plans are more structured and detailed\n- Ensure templates are properly applied to relevant scenarios\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- More consistent and detailed plans\n- Better structured approach to complex modifications\n- Increased success rate for modifications\n\nThis plan addresses several key areas to improve the agent's capabilities for self-modification, focusing on making changes more rapidly and consistently while reducing errors."
