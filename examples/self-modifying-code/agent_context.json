This story should be a paragraph, and written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. This raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.",

This is the file that needs to be modified to achieve the current goal.\n\nPlan to achieve the current goal:\n\n1. Files to be modified: README.md in the root directory of the project.\n\n2. Changes to be made: \n    - Add a new section in the README.md file titled 'A Raccoon's Tale'.\n    - In the new section, write a paragraph from the raccoon's perspective. The paragraph should be composed of 50% words and 50% emojis as per the current goal.\n\n3. Validation of changes: \n    - Ensure that the new section flows well with the existing content of the README.md file.\n    - Validate that the paragraph in the new section is half words and half emojis. This could be visually inspected or done using a script to count the number of words and emojis.\n    - Verify that the markdown formatting in the new section is correct and consistent with the rest of the README.md file.\n\n4. Expected outcome: \n    - The README.md file will have a new section titled 'A Raccoon's Tale'.\n    - The new section will contain a paragraph from the perspective of a raccoon infrastructure engineer. The paragraph will be composed of 50% words and 50% emojis.\n    - The new section will blend seamlessly with the rest of the README.md file and follow the same markdown formatting."
