      "details": "Now that I've explored the codebase, I'll create a plan to improve the agent's capabilities to make changes more rapidly and consistently.\n\n# Plan to Improve Agent Capabilities for Rapid and Consistent Code Changes\n\n## 1. Create a Code Analysis Tool\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/analyzeCodeTool.tsx`\n- Update `agent/codeAgent.tsx` to import and use the new tool\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Create a new tool that analyzes code to identify patterns, dependencies, and potential issues\n2. Implement functionality to scan files for:\n   - Import relationships\n   - Function dependencies\n   - Code complexity metrics\n   - Potential bugs or issues\n3. The tool should provide structured output that helps the agent understand code context\n4. Add the tool to the available tools in the CodeAgent component\n\n**Validation:**\n- Verify the build succeeds with `pnpm build`\n- Test the tool with sample code analysis requests\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- The agent will have better understanding of code structure before making changes\n- More informed decisions about what needs to be modified and potential impacts\n\n## 2. Implement a Code Testing Framework\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/testTool.tsx`\n- Update `agent/codeAgent.tsx` to import and use the new tool\n- Update `agent/smcAgent.tsx` to include testing in the workflow\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Create a test tool that can:\n   - Run unit tests for specific components\n   - Validate changes against predefined test cases\n   - Generate simple test cases for new functionality\n2. Add testing capabilities to the agent workflow\n3. Implement validation steps before committing changes\n\n**Validation:**\n- Verify the build succeeds with `pnpm build`\n- Run sample tests to ensure the framework works correctly\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- Higher confidence in code changes with automated testing\n- Reduced likelihood of introducing bugs\n- Faster validation of changes\n\n## 3. Create a Change Planning Component\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/steps/planCodeChanges.tsx`\n- Update `agent/smcAgent.tsx` to include the new planning step\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Create a structured planning component that:\n   - Breaks down complex changes into atomic steps\n   - Identifies dependencies between changes\n   - Prioritizes changes in optimal order\n   - Creates a detailed execution plan\n2. Integrate this component into the agent workflow before code modification\n\n**Validation:**\n- Verify the build succeeds with `pnpm build`\n- Test with a sample change request to ensure proper planning\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- More organized approach to code changes\n- Better handling of complex modifications\n- Reduced likelihood of missed steps or requirements\n\n## 4. Implement a Self-Monitoring System\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/monitorTool.tsx`\n- Update `agent/smcAgent.tsx` to include monitoring\n- Update `workspace.tsx` to track performance metrics\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Create a monitoring tool that:\n   - Tracks success/failure rates of changes\n   - Measures time taken for different operations\n   - Identifies patterns in failed attempts\n   - Suggests improvements based on historical performance\n2. Update the workspace context to store performance metrics\n3. Add self-reflection steps after each modification attempt\n\n**Validation:**\n- Verify the build succeeds with `pnpm build`\n- Test monitoring with sample workflows\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- The agent will learn from past mistakes and successes\n- Performance will improve over time through self-optimization\n- More consistent results across different types of changes\n\n## 5. Enhance Error Handling and Recovery\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/errorHandlingTool.tsx`\n- Update `agent/codeAgent.tsx` to improve error handling\n- Update `agent/smcAgent.tsx` to include recovery mechanisms\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Implement improved error detection and handling:\n   - More detailed error analysis\n   - Categorization of common errors\n   - Automated recovery strategies for known issues\n2. Add the ability to roll back changes when errors occur\n3. Implement partial success handling for complex changes\n\n**Validation:**\n- Verify the build succeeds with `pnpm build`\n- Test with intentionally problematic code changes\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- More resilient agent that can recover from errors\n- Reduced likelihood of failed change attempts\n- Better handling of partial successes\n\nThis plan focuses on adding tools and components that will significantly improve the agent's ability to make code changes rapidly and consistently, while building towards a system that can modify its own source code with high confidence and accuracy."

      "details": "Successfully implemented multiple new tools to enhance the self-modifying code agent's capabilities. Created five new components: (1) Code Analysis Tool to understand code context, (2) Testing Framework for validation, (3) Code Planning Component to break down changes, (4) Self-Monitoring System to track performance, and (5) Enhanced Error Handling for recovery. Updated existing files including codeAgent.tsx, smcAgent.tsx, and workspace.tsx to integrate these new tools. The build completed successfully with no errors."
