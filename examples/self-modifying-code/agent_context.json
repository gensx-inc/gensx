      "result": "success",
      "details": "Based on the project structure, there are several files that need to be reviewed for idiomatic and clear code:\n\n- README.md\n- agent directory (all files within)\n- agent_context.json\n- dist directory (all files within)\n- eslint.config.mjs\n- index.tsx\n- lease.ts\n- nodemon.json\n- package.json\n- tsconfig.json\n- workspace.tsx\n\nLet's create a plan:\n\n1. **What files need to be modified?** All the mentioned files and directories. Special attention should be given to TypeScript (.ts and .tsx) files as these contain the actual codebase.\n\n2. **What changes need to be made?** \n\n    - For TypeScript files, ensure that the code is idiomatic according to the GenSX guidelines. This includes but is not limited to:\n        - Proper use of TypeScript types and interfaces.\n        - Use of arrow functions where appropriate.\n        - Use of async/await for asynchronous operations.\n        - Proper use of modules and exports.\n    - For JSON files (package.json, tsconfig.json, nodemon.json, agent_context.json), ensure that the structure and keys used are idiomatic and clear.\n    - For the eslint.config.mjs, ensure that the ESLint configuration is set up according to the GenSX guidelines.\n    - For the README.md, ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and follows the GenSX documentation standards.\n\n3. **How we'll validate the changes?** \n\n    - For TypeScript files, compile the code and run it to ensure there are no syntax or runtime errors. Use TypeScript's type checking feature to ensure type safety. Use ESLint to ensure code quality.\n    - For JSON and .mjs files, validate the syntax and structure using a JSON validator and JavaScript linter respectively.\n    - For the README.md, ensure that the markdown renders correctly and the documentation makes sense.\n\n4. **What the expected outcome will be?** \n   \n   The codebase should become more idiomatic and easier to understand, which will make it easier for other developers to contribute to the project. The code will adhere to the GenSX project guidelines and standards, which will improve its overall quality and maintainability. The documentation will be clear and concise, providing a good overview and understanding of the project and its structure."

      "action": "Attempted code modifications",
      "result": "success",
      "details": "The code modification involved updating TypeScript and JSX files to use arrow functions, adding explicit return types, and improving error handling in async operations. JSON and configuration files were also verified for structure and ESLint settings were aligned with GenSX guidelines. The TypeScript configuration was checked for strict mode. Documentation in README.md was updated for clarity and standard compliance. The project was successfully built and validated with `pnpm build`, ESLint checks, and documentation review, ensuring code quality and adherence to guidelines."
