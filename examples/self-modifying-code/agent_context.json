This story should be a paragraph, and written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. This raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.",

      "details": "Based on the codebase exploration, we can see that there's a README.md file in the root directory. This is the file we need to modify to accomplish the goal.\n\nHere is the plan:\n\n1. Locate the README.md file in the root directory. This is the file that needs to be altered.\n\n2. Append a new section to README.md named 'From the Perspective of a Trash-Eating Raccoon'. This section should be located at the end of the current sections.\n\n3. In this section, tell a story from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. The raccoon has a limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis. This will require careful word selection and creative use of emojis to convey meaning.\n\n4. Ensure that the new section fits well with the existing content and doesn't disrupt the overall flow of the README.md. The story should be engaging, entertaining, and informative. \n\n5. Validate the changes by reviewing the updated README.md file. Confirm that the markdown formatting is correct and the new section is rendered properly. Also, check that the story meets the requirement of being 50% words and 50% emojis.\n\n6. The expected outcome is an updated README.md file with a new section telling a story from a unique perspective. It should add a touch of humor and creativity to the file, while still providing meaningful content."
