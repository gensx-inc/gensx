  "goalState": "After exploring the codebase, I now have a good understanding of the system architecture and components. This is a self-modifying code agent that can analyze a codebase, generate goals, create implementation plans, and make code changes to improve itself.\n\nBased on the history mentioned in the prompt, several improvements have already been implemented including error handling and recovery systems. However, I notice that while these components were mentioned in the history (errorAnalysisTool.tsx, diagnosticTool.tsx, etc.), they don't appear to be present in the actual codebase.\n\nHere's my proposed new goal:\n\n# New Goal Proposal\n\n\"Implement a version control and change tracking system that allows the agent to maintain a history of code modifications, compare versions, and roll back changes when necessary. This system should include functionality to track what changes were made, why they were made, and provide the ability to restore previous versions when needed.\"\n\n## Rationale:\n\nThis goal is specific, actionable, and focused on a single important improvement. Version control and change tracking are fundamental to safe self-modifying systems. By implementing this feature, the agent will:\n\n1. Have better visibility into what changes it has made over time\n2. Be able to compare different versions of files to understand the evolution\n3. Have the ability to roll back to previous versions when changes cause issues\n4. Maintain a historical record of modifications for analysis and learning\n\nThis goal builds on the previous improvements (error handling, validation) by adding another layer of safety and control to the agent's self-modification capabilities. It's especially important for a self-modifying system to be able to revert changes when they lead to unintended consequences.\n\nThe implementation would involve creating a dedicated version control tool, integrating it with the existing agent workflow, and adding appropriate commands for tracking, comparing, and reverting changes.",
