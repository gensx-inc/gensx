This story should be a paragraph, and written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. This raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.",

      "details": "Based on the exploration of the codebase, the file that needs to be modified is the README.md file located in the root directory.\n\nHere is the plan to achieve the current goal:\n\n1. **File to Modify**: README.md in the root directory of the project.\n\n2. **Changes to be made**: A new section will be added to the README.md. This section will be titled 'The Infrastructure Engineer Raccoon's Tale'. The content of this section will be a story from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating racoon. The racoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.\n\n3. **Validation of Changes**: Once the changes are made, we will open the README.md file to review the new section. The markdown formatting should appear correct and the story should fit the prescribed criteria. We will ensure that the tale is composed with 50% words and 50% emojis and that it is coherent and entertaining.\n\n4. **Expected Outcome**: After the changes, the README.md file will have a new section titled 'The Infrastructure Engineer Raccoon's Tale'. This section will contain a unique story told from the perspective of a raccoon infrastructure engineer, written with a balanced mix of words and emojis."
