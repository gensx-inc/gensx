  "goalState": "Based on the exploration of the codebase, here is the new goal to improve the codebase:\n\n**New Goal: Add Unit Tests for Core Functions**\n\n### Objective\n\nEnhance the codebase by adding unit tests to ensure the core functions work as expected. This will improve code reliability and maintainability.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Set Up Testing Framework**: Choose a testing framework like Jest or Mocha and add it to the project.\n2. **Identify Core Functions**: Determine the critical functions in the codebase that require testing. These could be functions within files like `index.tsx`, `lease.ts`, or any core utilities in the `agent` directory.\n3. **Write Unit Tests**: Develop unit tests for the identified functions. Ensure these tests cover a variety of cases, including edge cases.\n4. **Integrate with CI**: If not already done, integrate the testing into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure tests are run on every commit.\n5. **Documentation**: Update the README or internal documentation to reflect the addition of unit tests and how to run them.\n\nBy achieving this goal, the codebase will benefit from increased confidence in changes, easier debugging, and improved code quality.",

      "details": "Plan to add a new section \"A Raccoon's Tale\" to the README:\n\n1. Locate the README.md file in the root directory. This is the file that needs to be modified.\n2. Add a new section titled 'A Raccoon's Tale' after the \"Killing all agents\" section. This will be our new section where we will add the story.\n3. Write a paragraph from the raccoon's perspective using 50% words and 50% emojis. The story will be about an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. Bear in mind the raccoon's speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.\n4. Ensure the new section flows well with the existing content. The story should be coherent and well-integrated with the rest of the README.\n5. Verify the markdown formatting is correct. Markdown is the formatting language used in README files, and it needs to be properly used to ensure the README is displayed correctly on platforms like GitHub.\n6. Check that the text and emojis are evenly split in the new section. This is to adhere to the raccoon's speech limitation as mentioned in the goal.\n7. Save the changes and view the README.md file to ensure the new section is added and displays as expected.\n\nExpected Outcome:\n\nThe README.md file will have a new section titled 'A Raccoon's Tale' which contains a paragraph written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. The paragraph will be a mix of words and emojis, with each making up 50% of the content. The new section will flow well with the existing content and the markdown formatting will be correct."

      "details": "Based on the exploration of the codebase, we've identified several core functions in `index.tsx`, `lease.ts`, and the `agent` directory files (specifically `codeAgent.tsx` and `smcAgent.tsx`). These are likely the functions that need unit tests.\n\nHere's a specific plan to add unit tests for these functions:\n\n1. **Set Up the Testing Framework**: We'll choose Jest as our testing framework. Install it as a dev dependency in the project using npm or yarn. Also, install `@types/jest` for TypeScript support.\n\n2. **Identify Core Functions**: The core functions identified in `index.tsx` are `getWorkspaceConfig`, `startNewAgent`, and `main`. In `lease.ts`, the core functions are `ensureLeaseDirExists`, `acquireLease`, `releaseLease`, and `renewLease`. In `agent/codeAgent.tsx`, the core function is `CodeAgent`. In `agent/smcAgent.tsx`, the core function is `SelfModifyingCodeAgent`.\n\n3. **Write Unit Tests**: For each of the identified functions, create a new test file in a `__tests__` directory. The test file should have the same name as the original file but with a `.test.ts` extension. In each test file, write several unit tests that cover various cases, including edge cases. For example, in `getWorkspaceConfig.test.ts`, you could write tests to verify that the function correctly throws an error when environment variables are missing.\n\n4. **Integrate with CI**: If the project has a CI/CD pipeline set up (like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Travis CI), add a new step in the pipeline configuration file to run the unit tests on every commit.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Update the `README.md` file to include a new section on running unit tests. The section should explain that Jest is used for unit testing, and it should provide the command for running the tests (typically `npm test` or `yarn test`).\n\nThis plan should help improve code reliability and maintainability by ensuring core functions work as expected."
