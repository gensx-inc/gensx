      "details": "Now that I've explored the codebase, I'll create a plan to improve the agent's capabilities for making changes more rapidly and consistently:\n\n# Plan to Improve Agent Capabilities\n\n## 1. Create a Utility Library for Common Operations\n\n### Files to Create:\n- `agent/utils/fileOperations.tsx`\n\n### Changes:\n1. Create a utility library that abstracts common file operations\n2. Implement functions for:\n   - Reading file contents with error handling\n   - Writing files with automatic backup\n   - Finding files by pattern or content\n   - Validating file content before writing\n3. Add logging capabilities to track operations\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- Reduced code duplication\n- More consistent error handling\n- Better traceability of file operations\n\n## 2. Add Code Analysis Tools\n\n### Files to Create:\n- `agent/tools/analysisTool.tsx`\n\n### Changes:\n1. Create a new tool that can analyze code structure\n2. Implement functionality to:\n   - Parse and understand TypeScript/JavaScript code\n   - Identify functions, classes, and their relationships\n   - Extract documentation and type information\n   - Validate changes against TypeScript compiler\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- Better understanding of code structure before making changes\n- Reduced errors when modifying complex components\n- More accurate code generation\n\n## 3. Enhance Validation Capabilities\n\n### Files to Modify:\n- `agent/tools/buildTool.tsx`\n\n### Changes:\n1. Extend the build tool to provide more detailed feedback\n2. Add functionality to:\n   - Run TypeScript type checking separately from build\n   - Run targeted tests for modified files\n   - Provide more detailed error information\n   - Validate changes incrementally before full build\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- Faster feedback cycle\n- More specific error messages\n- Better understanding of build failures\n\n## 4. Implement Code Templating System\n\n### Files to Create:\n- `agent/utils/codeTemplates.tsx`\n\n### Changes:\n1. Create a templating system for common code patterns\n2. Include templates for:\n   - Component creation\n   - Tool implementation\n   - Test file structure\n   - Common TypeScript patterns\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- More consistent code generation\n- Reduced errors in boilerplate code\n- Faster implementation of new components\n\n## 5. Add Change Planning and Tracking\n\n### Files to Create:\n- `agent/utils/changePlanner.tsx`\n\n### Changes:\n1. Create a system to plan and track changes across multiple files\n2. Implement functionality to:\n   - Record dependencies between files\n   - Track planned changes before execution\n   - Validate consistency across related changes\n   - Roll back changes if validation fails\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- More coordinated multi-file changes\n- Better handling of complex refactoring\n- Reduced risk of partial, broken changes\n\n## Validation Approach\n\n1. After implementing each component:\n   - Run TypeScript compiler to check for type errors\n   - Use the build tool to verify the build succeeds\n   - Test the new functionality with simple use cases\n\n2. Final validation:\n   - Ensure all tests pass\n   - Verify the build process completes successfully\n   - Test the agent with a simple code modification task\n\nThis plan provides a comprehensive approach to improving the agent's capabilities for making code changes more rapidly and consistently, focusing on tools and utilities that will enhance code understanding, generation, and validation."

      "details": "Successfully implemented several new components to enhance the agent's code modification capabilities: (1) Created a file operations utility library with reading, writing, and backup functions, (2) Developed a code analysis tool for parsing and understanding code structure, (3) Enhanced the build tool with detailed feedback and multiple build modes, (4) Built a code templating system for common patterns, (5) Implemented a change planning and tracking system with rollback capabilities, (6) Updated the code agent to integrate these new tools, and (7) Added the 'glob' package dependency. All changes were verified with a successful build."
