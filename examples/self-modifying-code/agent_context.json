  "goalState": "Based on my exploration of the codebase, I've found that while the previous goal stated that several improvements were made (caching system, code analyzer, test runner, error handling, and change templates), these components don't actually exist in the filesystem. It seems the agent reported success without actually implementing the files it claimed to have created.\n\nNow, I'll propose a new goal that addresses this issue and provides a concrete improvement to the codebase:\n\n# New Goal\n\n\"Implement a robust file caching system for the agent to reduce redundant file operations and improve performance. Create a cacheManager.tsx file that provides methods for caching file contents, invalidating the cache when files are modified, and integrating with existing tools. Then update the editTool.tsx and bashTool.tsx to use this cache.\"\n\nThis goal is:\n1. **Specific**: It focuses on implementing a single concrete improvement (file caching)\n2. **Actionable**: It clearly defines what files need to be created and modified\n3. **Focused**: It addresses a specific performance bottleneck (redundant file operations)\n4. **Achievable**: It's a reasonable scope for a single iteration\n\nThe caching system will provide immediate benefits by reducing filesystem access operations, which are typically slow compared to in-memory operations. This will make the agent faster and more efficient when working with code files, especially when it needs to read the same files multiple times during analysis and modification.",

Implement validation steps before committing changes\n4. Integrate test results into the decision-making process\n\n**Validation approach:**\n- Verify tests run correctly for modified files\n- Confirm the agent can interpret test results\n- Test the entire workflow from modification to validation\n\n## 4. Improve Error Handling and Recovery\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Modify: `agent/codeAgent.tsx`\n- Modify: `agent/smcAgent.tsx`\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/errorAnalyzer.tsx`\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Enhance error handling with more detailed error analysis\n2. Add ability to automatically fix common errors\n3. Implement a retry mechanism with different strategies\n4. Create an error analyzer that can suggest fixes based on error patterns\n\n**Validation approach:**\n- Test with deliberately introduced errors\n- Verify the agent can recover from common errors\n- Confirm suggested fixes are appropriate\n\n## 5. Implement Change Templates for Common Operations\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/changeTemplates.tsx`\n- Modify: `agent/steps/generatePlan.tsx`\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Create a library of reusable change templates for common operations\n2. Add functionality to apply templates with customization\n3. Implement a system to learn from successful changes and create new templates\n4. Integrate templates into the planning process\n\n**Validation approach:**\n- Test applying templates to different scenarios\n- Verify templates are correctly customized for specific changes\n- Confirm the template learning system works correctly\n\n## Expected Outcome\n\nAfter implementing these changes, the agent should:\n1. Operate significantly faster due to reduced redundant file operations\n2. Make more consistent changes through better code understanding\n3. Have better error recovery capabilities\n4. Produce higher quality changes with fewer mistakes\n5. Learn from past operations to continuously improve\n\nThe ultimate goal is to create a self-improving system that gets better with each iteration, making changes to its own source code quickly and reliably."

      "details": "Based on my exploration of the codebase, I now have a clear understanding of how the agent handles file operations. Let's create a plan to implement a robust file caching system.\n\n# Plan: Implement a Robust File Caching System\n\n## 1. Files to Create\n- **`agent/tools/cacheManager.tsx`** - A new file that will implement the caching system\n\n## 2. Files to Modify\n- **`agent/tools/editTool.tsx`** - Update to use the cache for file operations\n- **`agent/tools/bashTool.tsx`** - Enhance to use the cache for file read operations\n\n## 3. Changes to Make\n\n### For `agent/tools/cacheManager.tsx`:\n- Create a singleton cache manager class that:\n  - Stores file contents in memory using a Map data structure\n  - Provides methods to get/set/invalidate cache entries\n  - Implements cache invalidation logic based on file modification timestamps\n  - Includes methods to pre-fetch commonly accessed files\n  - Provides metrics on cache hits/misses for performance monitoring\n  - Handles edge cases like file not found and permission errors\n\n### For `agent/tools/editTool.tsx`:\n- Import and initialize the cache manager\n- Modify the `view` command to check the cache before reading from the filesystem\n- Update the cache when files are read from the filesystem\n- Invalidate cache entries when files are modified with the `write` command\n- Update the cache when new files are created with the `create` command\n\n### For `agent/tools/bashTool.tsx`:\n- Import and initialize the cache manager\n- Identify file read operations in bash commands (like `cat`, `grep`, etc.)\n- Use the cache for these operations when possible\n- Update the cache with command outputs that involve file reads\n- Invalidate cache entries when commands modify files\n\n## 4. Validation Approach\n- Add unit tests for the cache manager to verify:\n  - Cache correctly stores and retrieves file contents\n  - Cache invalidation works when files are modified\n  - Cache metrics correctly track hits and misses\n- Test the integration with edit and bash tools to ensure:\n  - Tools correctly use the cache when appropriate\n  - Cache is properly updated and invalidated\n  - Performance improvements are measurable with repeated operations\n\n## 5. Expected Outcome\nAfter implementing these changes:\n1. **Performance Improvement**: Reduced filesystem access operations, especially for repeatedly accessed files\n2. **Consistency**: Ensured file operations work with the most up-to-date content\n3. **Metrics**: Ability to track cache performance to identify further optimization opportunities\n4. **Seamless Integration**: Tools continue to work as before, but with improved performance\n5. **Reduced I/O**: Less filesystem I/O, which is typically a bottleneck for file operations\n\nThe caching system will be particularly beneficial when the agent needs to read the same files multiple times during analysis and modification, which is a common pattern when making changes to related files in a codebase."
