  "goalState": "Based on the structure of the codebase, here's a proposed improvement goal focused on enhancing the efficiency and maintainability of the development workflow.\n\n**New Goal: Implement Prettier for Code Formatting**\n\n1. **Objective**: Integrate Prettier into the project to automate code formatting, ensuring code consistency across the entire codebase.\n\n2. **Steps**:\n   - Install Prettier as a development dependency in the project.\n   - Configure Prettier with a `.prettierrc` file to establish consistent code formatting rules.\n   - Add a script in `package.json` to format the codebase using Prettier.\n   - Run Prettier on the codebase to apply consistent formatting.\n   - Optionally, update the build process to include Prettier checks, ensuring code formatting is maintained in future developments.\n\n3. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - Consistent code formatting across the codebase, making it easier to read and maintain.\n   - Automated formatting reduces the effort required from developers to adhere to style guides.\n   - Improved collaboration as code style issues are minimized, focusing reviews on functionality rather than style. \n\nThis goal will complement the existing ESLint setup by ensuring both code quality and style consistency.",

      "details": "The codebase exploration shows there is a README.md file in the root directory of the project. This is the file that needs to be modified to achieve the current goal.\n\nPlan to achieve the current goal:\n\n1. Files to be modified: README.md in the root directory of the project.\n\n2. Changes to be made: \n    - Add a new section in the README.md file titled 'A Raccoon's Tale'.\n    - In the new section, write a paragraph from the raccoon's perspective. The paragraph should be composed of 50% words and 50% emojis as per the current goal.\n\n3. Validation of changes: \n    - Ensure that the new section flows well with the existing content of the README.md file.\n    - Validate that the paragraph in the new section is half words and half emojis. This could be visually inspected or done using a script to count the number of words and emojis.\n    - Verify that the markdown formatting in the new section is correct and consistent with the rest of the README.md file.\n\n4. Expected outcome: \n    - The README.md file will have a new section titled 'A Raccoon's Tale'.\n    - The new section will contain a paragraph from the perspective of a raccoon infrastructure engineer. The paragraph will be composed of 50% words and 50% emojis.\n    - The new section will blend seamlessly with the rest of the README.md file and follow the same markdown formatting."

ESLint was run to automatically fix and identify issues, and warnings about unused variables were noted but not enforced as errors. The build process was executed using `pnpm build`, which completed successfully, ensuring the code adheres to the updated linting rules.
