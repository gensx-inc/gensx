  "goalState": "Based on my exploration of the codebase, I now have a good understanding of the system. The history shows that the agent has already successfully implemented improvements to its capabilities for making changes rapidly and consistently. However, when I checked for the files mentioned in the history (testTool.tsx, analysisTool.tsx, errorAnalysisTool.tsx, validateChanges.tsx), they don't appear to exist in the codebase.\n\nHere's my proposed new goal:\n\n# New Goal Proposal\n\n\"Implement a comprehensive error handling and recovery system that allows the agent to gracefully recover from failures during code modifications. This should include detailed error analysis, suggestions for fixes, and the ability to retry failed operations with appropriate adjustments.\"\n\nThis goal is specific, actionable, and focuses on a single important improvement. Error handling is a critical aspect of reliable software systems, especially for self-modifying code. By implementing robust error handling, the agent will:\n\n1. Be more resilient to failures during code modifications\n2. Provide better feedback when errors occur\n3. Be able to learn from past mistakes and avoid them in the future\n4. Have the ability to retry operations with adjustments rather than completely failing\n\nThis goal builds upon the previous improvements to make the agent more reliable and capable of handling edge cases and unexpected situations, which is essential for a self-modifying system.",

Update `agent/codeAgent.tsx`\n   - Improve error handling to provide more context\n   - Add recovery mechanisms for failed code modifications\n\n## Validation Approach\n\n1. After implementing each improvement:\n   - Run a full build to ensure changes compile successfully\n   - Verify that the new tools work as expected\n   - Test that the agent can use the new capabilities effectively\n\n2. Measure improvements:\n   - Track build and validation times before and after changes\n   - Monitor success rate of code modifications\n   - Evaluate the quality of generated code\n\n## Expected Outcome\n\n1. The agent will be able to:\n   - Make code changes more confidently with automated testing\n   - Identify and fix issues before they cause build failures\n   - Recover from errors more effectively\n   - Complete modifications more quickly with optimized builds\n\n2. The codebase will be more robust with:\n   - Better validation of changes\n   - Improved error handling\n   - Faster build and test cycles\n   - More comprehensive analysis of code quality\n\nThis plan focuses on adding tools and capabilities that will directly improve the agent's ability to make changes quickly and without mistakes, addressing the current goal."
