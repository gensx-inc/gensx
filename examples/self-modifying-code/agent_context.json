      "details": "Based on my exploration of the codebase, I now have a good understanding of the system and can create a plan to improve the agent's capabilities to make changes more rapidly and consistently. Here's my plan:\n\n# Plan to Improve Agent Capabilities for Faster and More Consistent Code Changes\n\n## 1. Add Automated Testing Capabilities\n\n1. Create a new `agent/tools/testTool.tsx` file\n   - Implement a tool that can run tests on code changes\n   - Include functionality to validate changes beyond just build success\n   - Add ability to run specific test cases on modified components\n\n2. Modify `agent/codeAgent.tsx`\n   - Add the new test tool to the available tools array\n   - Update the code agent prompt to include instructions about testing changes\n\n3. Update `workspace.tsx`\n   - Add a `runTests` function to execute tests on the codebase\n   - Implement test result parsing and reporting\n\n## 2. Implement a Code Analysis Tool\n\n1. Create a new `agent/tools/analysisTool.tsx` file\n   - Implement static code analysis capabilities\n   - Add functionality to identify code patterns and potential issues\n   - Include suggestions for code improvements\n\n2. Modify `agent/smcAgent.tsx`\n   - Add a new step for code analysis before modification\n   - Integrate analysis results into the planning process\n\n## 3. Create a Change Validation System\n\n1. Create a new `agent/steps/validateChanges.tsx` component\n   - Implement thorough validation of changes beyond just build success\n   - Add checks for code quality, potential regressions, and adherence to standards\n\n2. Update `agent/smcAgent.tsx`\n   - Add the validation step to the workflow\n   - Ensure validation results are properly recorded in history\n\n## 4. Implement a Caching System for Faster Builds\n\n1. Modify `workspace.tsx`\n   - Add a caching mechanism for build artifacts\n   - Implement incremental builds to speed up the validation process\n\n2. Update `validateBuild` function\n   - Optimize build process to only rebuild changed files when possible\n\n## 5. Enhance Error Handling and Recovery\n\n1. Create a new `agent/tools/errorAnalysisTool.tsx`\n   - Implement tool to analyze build and test errors\n   - Add functionality to suggest fixes for common errors\n\n2. Update `agent/codeAgent.tsx`\n   - Improve error handling to provide more context\n   - Add recovery mechanisms for failed code modifications\n\n## Validation Approach\n\n1. After implementing each improvement:\n   - Run a full build to ensure changes compile successfully\n   - Verify that the new tools work as expected\n   - Test that the agent can use the new capabilities effectively\n\n2. Measure improvements:\n   - Track build and validation times before and after changes\n   - Monitor success rate of code modifications\n   - Evaluate the quality of generated code\n\n## Expected Outcome\n\n1. The agent will be able to:\n   - Make code changes more confidently with automated testing\n   - Identify and fix issues before they cause build failures\n   - Recover from errors more effectively\n   - Complete modifications more quickly with optimized builds\n\n2. The codebase will be more robust with:\n   - Better validation of changes\n   - Improved error handling\n   - Faster build and test cycles\n   - More comprehensive analysis of code quality\n\nThis plan focuses on adding tools and capabilities that will directly improve the agent's ability to make changes quickly and without mistakes, addressing the current goal."

      "result": "success",
      "details": "Successfully implemented multiple new features to enhance the agent's capabilities for making changes rapidly and consistently. Added automated testing (testTool.tsx), code analysis (analysisTool.tsx), change validation system (validateChanges.tsx), error handling (errorAnalysisTool.tsx), and a caching system for faster builds. Updated core components including codeAgent.tsx, smcAgent.tsx, and workspace.tsx to integrate these new features into the agent workflow. All changes were successfully built and integrated."
