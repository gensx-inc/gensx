Create a Code Analysis Tool\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/analyzeCodeTool.tsx`\n- Update `agent/codeAgent.tsx` to import and use the new tool\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Create a new tool that analyzes code to identify patterns, dependencies, and potential issues\n2. Implement functionality to scan files for:\n   - Import relationships\n   - Function dependencies\n   - Code complexity metrics\n   - Potential bugs or issues\n3. The tool should provide structured output that helps the agent understand code context\n4. Add the tool to the available tools in the CodeAgent component\n\n**Validation:**\n- Verify the build succeeds with `pnpm build`\n- Test the tool with sample code analysis requests\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- The agent will have better understanding of code structure before making changes\n- More informed decisions about what needs to be modified and potential impacts\n\n## 2. Implement a Code Testing Framework\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/testTool.tsx`\n- Update `agent/codeAgent.tsx` to import and use the new tool\n- Update `agent/smcAgent.tsx` to include testing in the workflow\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1.

Add testing capabilities to the agent workflow\n3. Implement validation steps before committing changes\n\n**Validation:**\n- Verify the build succeeds with `pnpm build`\n- Run sample tests to ensure the framework works correctly\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- Higher confidence in code changes with automated testing\n- Reduced likelihood of introducing bugs\n- Faster validation of changes\n\n## 3. Create a Change Planning Component\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/steps/planCodeChanges.tsx`\n- Update `agent/smcAgent.tsx` to include the new planning step\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Create a structured planning component that:\n   - Breaks down complex changes into atomic steps\n   - Identifies dependencies between changes\n   - Prioritizes changes in optimal order\n   - Creates a detailed execution plan\n2. Integrate this component into the agent workflow before code modification\n\n**Validation:**\n- Verify the build succeeds with `pnpm build`\n- Test with a sample change request to ensure proper planning\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- More organized approach to code changes\n- Better handling of complex modifications\n- Reduced likelihood of missed steps or requirements\n\n## 4. Implement a Self-Monitoring System\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/monitorTool.tsx`\n- Update `agent/smcAgent.tsx` to include monitoring\n- Update `workspace.tsx` to track performance metrics\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Create a monitoring tool that:\n   - Tracks success/failure rates of changes\n   - Measures time taken for different operations\n   - Identifies patterns in failed attempts\n   - Suggests improvements based on historical performance\n2. Update the workspace context to store performance metrics\n3. Add self-reflection steps after each modification attempt\n\n**Validation:**\n- Verify the build succeeds with `pnpm build`\n- Test monitoring with sample workflows\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- The agent will learn from past mistakes and successes\n- Performance will improve over time through self-optimization\n- More consistent results across different types of changes\n\n## 5. Enhance Error Handling and Recovery\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- Create new file: `agent/tools/errorHandlingTool.tsx`\n- Update `agent/codeAgent.tsx` to improve error handling\n- Update `agent/smcAgent.tsx` to include recovery mechanisms\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Implement improved error detection and handling:\n   - More detailed error analysis\n   - Categorization of common errors\n   - Automated recovery strategies for known issues\n2. Add the ability to roll back changes when errors occur\n3. Implement partial success handling for complex changes\n\n**Validation:**\n- Verify the build succeeds with `pnpm build`\n- Test with intentionally problematic code changes\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n- More resilient agent that can recover from errors\n- Reduced likelihood of failed change attempts\n- Better handling of partial successes\n\nThis plan focuses on adding tools and components that will significantly improve the agent's ability to make code changes rapidly and consistently, while building towards a system that can modify its own source code with high confidence and accuracy."
