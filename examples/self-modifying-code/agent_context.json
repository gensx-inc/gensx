  "goalState": "Based on the structure of the codebase, here's a proposed new goal to improve the codebase:\n\n### New Goal:\n**Implement ESLint to Improve Code Quality**\n\nThe project contains a configuration file for ESLint (`eslint.config.mjs`), but it's unclear if ESLint is actively being used to enforce coding standards across the codebase. Ensuring that ESLint is set up and configured to run with the project can help maintain code quality and consistency.\n\n#### Steps to Achieve This Goal:\n1. **Verify ESLint Configuration:**\n   - Review the `eslint.config.mjs` file to ensure it is properly configured with rules that align with the project's coding standards.\n\n2. **Integrate ESLint into the Development Workflow:**\n   - Set up ESLint to run automatically on certain events, such as before a commit, to catch any issues early.\n\n3. **Run ESLint on the Codebase:**\n   - Execute ESLint to identify any existing code quality issues within the codebase.\n\n4. **Fix Identified Issues:**\n   - Resolve any issues identified by ESLint to improve code quality.\n\n5. **Update Documentation:**\n   - Add instructions in the `README.md` on how to run ESLint manually and explain its integration into the development workflow.\n\nThis goal focuses on improving the codebase by enforcing coding standards, which can lead to more maintainable and error-free code.",

      "details": "Based on the exploration of the codebase, the file that needs to be modified is the README.md file located in the root directory.\n\nHere is the plan to achieve the current goal:\n\n1. **File to Modify**: README.md in the root directory of the project.\n\n2. **Changes to be made**: A new section will be added to the README.md. This section will be titled 'The Infrastructure Engineer Raccoon's Tale'. The content of this section will be a story from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating racoon. The racoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.\n\n3. **Validation of Changes**: Once the changes are made, we will open the README.md file to review the new section. The markdown formatting should appear correct and the story should fit the prescribed criteria. We will ensure that the tale is composed with 50% words and 50% emojis and that it is coherent and entertaining.\n\n4. **Expected Outcome**: After the changes, the README.md file will have a new section titled 'The Infrastructure Engineer Raccoon's Tale'. This section will contain a unique story told from the perspective of a raccoon infrastructure engineer, written with a balanced mix of words and emojis."
