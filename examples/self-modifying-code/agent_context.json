      "details": "The codebase exploration shows there is a README.md file in the root directory of the project. This is the file that needs to be modified to achieve the current goal.\n\nPlan to achieve the current goal:\n\n1. Files to be modified: README.md in the root directory of the project.\n\n2. Changes to be made: \n    - Add a new section in the README.md file titled 'A Raccoon's Tale'.\n    - In the new section, write a paragraph from the raccoon's perspective. The paragraph should be composed of 50% words and 50% emojis as per the current goal.\n\n3. Validation of changes: \n    - Ensure that the new section flows well with the existing content of the README.md file.\n    - Validate that the paragraph in the new section is half words and half emojis. This could be visually inspected or done using a script to count the number of words and emojis.\n    - Verify that the markdown formatting in the new section is correct and consistent with the rest of the README.md file.\n\n4. Expected outcome: \n    - The README.md file will have a new section titled 'A Raccoon's Tale'.\n    - The new section will contain a paragraph from the perspective of a raccoon infrastructure engineer. The paragraph will be composed of 50% words and 50% emojis.\n    - The new section will blend seamlessly with the rest of the README.md file and follow the same markdown formatting."

      "details": "The ESLint configuration file `eslint.config.mjs` was modified to enforce code quality standards such as requiring semicolons, using double quotes, and setting an indentation of 2 spaces. Additionally, a rule was added to warn about unused variables without causing build failures. ESLint was run to automatically fix and identify issues, and warnings about unused variables were noted but not enforced as errors. The build process was executed using `pnpm build`, which completed successfully, ensuring the code adheres to the updated linting rules. This improves the codebase's consistency and quality, with future code developments set to maintain these standards."
