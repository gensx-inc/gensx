      "details": "Based on my exploration of the codebase, I'll now create a plan to achieve the goal of improving the agent's capabilities for making changes more rapidly and consistently.\n\n# Plan to Improve Agent Capabilities\n\n## 1. Create a Code Analysis Utility\n\n**Files to modify:**\n1. Create new file: `agent/utils/codeAnalyzer.tsx`\n2. Update `agent/codeAgent.tsx` to integrate the analyzer\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Implement a code analyzer utility that can:\n   - Parse and understand the structure of TypeScript/JavaScript files\n   - Identify dependencies between files\n   - Detect potential issues before making changes\n   - Generate documentation for code components\n\n2. The analyzer should provide functions to:\n   - Map file relationships in the codebase\n   - Extract component interfaces and function signatures\n   - Validate proposed changes against existing code patterns\n   - Generate summary reports of code structure\n\n3. Integration with codeAgent:\n   - Add a pre-modification analysis step to understand code context\n   - Use analysis results to guide code changes\n   - Validate changes against existing patterns\n\n## 2. Implement a Testing Framework\n\n**Files to modify:**\n1. Create new directory: `agent/testing/`\n2. Create new files:\n   - `agent/testing/testRunner.tsx`\n   - `agent/testing/testUtils.tsx`\n3. Update `agent/smcAgent.tsx` to incorporate testing\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Develop a simple testing framework that can:\n   - Validate code changes before committing\n   - Run unit tests on modified components\n   - Check for regressions in existing functionality\n\n2. The test runner should:\n   - Support TypeScript testing\n   - Provide clear pass/fail results\n   - Generate detailed error reports\n   - Allow selective testing of only modified components\n\n3. Integration with smcAgent:\n   - Add a testing step between code modification and final validation\n   - Only proceed to final validation if tests pass\n   - Record test results in agent context history\n\n## 3. Enhance Error Handling and Recovery\n\n**Files to modify:**\n1. Create new file: `agent/utils/errorHandler.tsx`\n2. Update `agent/smcAgent.tsx` and `agent/codeAgent.tsx`\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Implement an error handling system that can:\n   - Capture and categorize different types of errors\n   - Provide specific recovery strategies for common errors\n   - Log detailed error information for future learning\n\n2. The error handler should:\n   - Distinguish between syntax errors, build errors, and logical errors\n   - Suggest possible fixes based on error type\n   - Track error patterns across iterations\n\n3. Integration with agents:\n   - Wrap key operations in error handlers\n   - Implement recovery strategies for common failure modes\n   - Add error analysis to agent context history\n\n## 4. Create a Change Planning System\n\n**Files to modify:**\n1. Enhance `agent/steps/generatePlan.tsx`\n2. Create new file: `agent/utils/planValidator.tsx`\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Improve the plan generation step to:\n   - Break down complex changes into smaller, safer steps\n   - Prioritize changes based on dependencies\n   - Include verification steps between changes\n\n2. The plan validator should:\n   - Check plan feasibility before execution\n   - Identify potential conflicts or risks\n   - Ensure all dependencies are addressed in the correct order\n\n3. Integration with plan generation:\n   - Add validation step after plan generation\n   - Refine plans based on validation feedback\n   - Include explicit rollback steps for risky changes\n\n## 5. Add Code Templates and Patterns Library\n\n**Files to modify:**\n1. Create new directory: `agent/templates/`\n2. Create template files for common patterns\n3. Update `agent/codeAgent.tsx` to use templates\n\n**Changes to make:**\n1. Build a library of code templates for:\n   - Common component structures\n   - Utility functions\n   - Testing patterns\n   - Error handling\n\n2. The templates should:\n   - Follow best practices for TypeScript/React development\n   - Include documentation and examples\n   - Be parameterized for easy customization\n\n3. Integration with code agent:\n   - Use templates when creating new components or functions\n   - Match existing code patterns when making modifications\n   - Ensure consistent style and structure across the codebase\n\n## Validation Approach\n\nTo validate these changes:\n1. Each component should be tested individually with unit tests\n2. Integration tests should verify components work together\n3. The build process should complete successfully\n4. A test run of the agent should demonstrate improved capabilities\n5. Changes should be tracked in agent context history to measure improvement\n\n## Expected Outcome\n\nAfter implementing these changes, the agent should be able to:\n1. Make code changes more rapidly through better understanding of the codebase\n2. Produce more consistent results by following established patterns\n3. Recover gracefully from errors without requiring manual intervention\n4. Plan and execute complex changes with fewer mistakes\n5. Track its own performance and learn from past iterations\n\nThis plan focuses on creating tools and frameworks that will enable the agent to make changes to its own source code more quickly and with fewer errors, addressing the current goal directly."
