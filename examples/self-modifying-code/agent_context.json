This story should be a paragraph, and written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. This raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.",

This section will be a paragraph written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. The raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis. The new section will be added after existing sections.\n\n3. **Validation of changes**: We can validate the changes by opening the README.md file and verifying that the new section has been added correctly. We should ensure that the new section flows well with the existing content and is written in the correct format, i.e., 50% words and 50% emojis. We also need to verify that the markdown formatting is correct.\n\n4. **Expected outcome**: The README.md file will have a new section. The section will be a story written from the perspective of a raccoon that uses 50% words and 50% emojis. The new section should blend in well with the existing content and the markdown formatting should be correct."
