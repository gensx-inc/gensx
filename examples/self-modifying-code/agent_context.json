This story should be a paragraph, and written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. This raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.",

      "details": "Based on the exploration of the codebase, there is a README.md file in the root directory. This is the file we will need to modify in order to achieve the current goal. \n\nHere is a plan for the modification:\n\n1. Locate the README.md file in the root directory. \n\n2. Add a new section to the README.md file. This section should be titled 'A Raccoon's Tale' and it should be placed at the end of the existing content. \n\n3. Write a paragraph in this new section from the perspective of an 'infrastructure engineer raccoon' who speaks in 50% words and 50% emojis. \n\n4. Ensure that the new section integrates well with the existing content and doesn't disrupt the flow of the README file. \n\n5. After the changes are made, verify the markdown formatting is correct. This can be done by previewing the README.md file in a Markdown viewer to ensure that all the formatting (including emojis) is displayed correctly. \n\n6. Save the changes to the README.md file. \n\nExpected Outcome:\nAfter the changes, the README.md file should have an additional section titled 'A Raccoon's Tale' that contains a paragraph from the perspective of an 'infrastructure engineer raccoon' using 50% words and 50% emojis. All formatting should be correct and the new section should fit well into the existing content."
