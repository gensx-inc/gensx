This story should be a paragraph, and written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. This raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.",

Files to be modified: `README.md` in the root directory.\n\n2. Changes to be made:\n   - A new section needs to be added to the README file. \n   - This section should have a title, for instance, 'A Raccoon's Life.' \n   - Under this section, a paragraph needs to be written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. \n   - The paragraph must be composed of 50% words and 50% emojis, as per the raccoon's speech limitation.\n\n3. Validate the changes:\n   - After the changes are made, the README.md file needs to be opened to review the new section.\n   - Ensure that the new section is well-integrated with the existing content, and the markdown formatting is correct.\n   - The balance of words and emojis in the paragraph should be confirmed to be 50/50.\n\n4. Expected outcome:\n   - The README.md file will have a new section titled 'A Raccoon's Life.'\n   - This section will contain a paragraph from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a raccoon, with the text being a combination of words and emojis in equal measure."
