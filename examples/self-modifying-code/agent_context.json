This story should be a paragraph, and written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. This raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.",

      "details": "Based on the exploration, we can see that there's a README.md file in the root directory of the project. This is the file that will need to be modified to achieve the current goal. Here's a plan:\n\n1. Locate the README.md file in the root directory.\n\n2. Identify the appropriate section to add the new 'A Raccoon's Tale' story. If there is no specific section for stories, we can add it at the end of the file.\n\n3. Write a paragraph from the raccoon's perspective using 50% words and 50% emojis. Be sure to create a unique and engaging narrative that fits within the context of the project.\n\n4. Make sure that the new story flows well with the rest of the content in the README.md file. It should not disrupt or contradict any existing information.\n\n5. Use Markdown syntax to format the new section. This will ensure that the content is displayed correctly when the README.md file is viewed on platforms that support Markdown rendering, such as GitHub.\n\n6. After the changes have been made, view the updated README.md file in a Markdown viewer to make sure that the formatting is correct. If any issues are identified, fix them and then recheck the file.\n\n7. Finally, commit the changes and push them to the project's repository. The updated README.md file should now be visible to all members of the project.\n\nThis plan focuses on what needs to be done to achieve the current goal. The specific details of how to implement these steps will depend on the tools and technologies that are being used."
