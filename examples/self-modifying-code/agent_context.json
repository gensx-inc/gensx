  "goalState": "Based on my exploration of the codebase, I can see that the agent was supposed to implement several improvements to enhance its capabilities for rapid and consistent code modifications. However, the files mentioned in the execution plan (cacheManager.tsx, codeAnalyzer.tsx, etc.) don't appear to exist in the codebase.\n\nAfter analyzing the current state of the codebase, I propose the following new goal:\n\n# New Goal\n\n\"Implement automated test generation for code modifications. Create a testing utility that can automatically generate unit tests for modified files, helping ensure that changes maintain expected functionality. This should include a test template system that creates test scaffolding based on the functions and classes in the modified files.\"\n\nThis goal is specific, actionable, and focused on a single improvement that would enhance the agent's ability to make changes safely. By adding automated test generation:\n\n1. The agent will be able to validate its changes beyond just build success\n2. It will reduce the risk of introducing regressions\n3. It will create documentation of expected behavior through tests\n4. It will encourage better code structure that's more testable\n\nThis goal builds on the previous improvements to make the agent more robust and reliable while making code modifications.",
