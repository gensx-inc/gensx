This story should be a paragraph, and written from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. This raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.",

      "details": "Based on the exploration of the codebase, we have a README.md file in the root directory of the project. This is where we'll be adding a new section \"A Raccoon's Tale\".\n\nPlan to achieve the current goal:\n\n1. Identify the File to Be Modified:\n   The file to be modified is the README.md file located in the root directory of the codebase.\n\n2. Define the Changes to be Made:\n   Add a new section at the end of the file, after \"Killing all agents\" section. The new section will be titled \"A Raccoon's Tale\". In this section, write a paragraph from the perspective of a raccoon who is an infrastructure engineer and eats trash. This raccoon has a speech limitation where he can only use 50% words and the other 50% must be expressed via emojis.\n\n3. Validate the Changes:\n   After making the changes, we'll need to confirm that the markdown is correctly formatted and the new section is properly displayed. This can be done by previewing the README.md file in a markdown viewer or on a platform that supports markdown rendering, like GitHub.\n\n4. Expected Outcome:\n   The README.md file should have a new section titled \"A Raccoon's Tale\" at the end of the document, written from the perspective of a raccoon infrastructure engineer, using 50% words and 50% emojis. The narrative should be fun, engaging, and fit well with the existing content of the README file. \n\nRemember, the actual content would need to comply with the requirements, i.e., written from the perspective of a trash-eating raccoon engineer, and achieving a 50% words and 50% emojis balance."
