  "goalState": "Based on the exploration of the codebase, here is an outline of the current structure and environment:\n\n- The project is named `@gensx-examples/self-modifying-code` and is a TypeScript module.\n- Key files include `index.tsx`, `lease.ts`, `workspace.tsx`, and several files under the `agent` directory.\n- The `agent` directory contains TypeScript files likely related to different agents (`codeAgent.tsx`, `smcAgent.tsx`) and tools (`bashTool.tsx`, `buildTool.tsx`, `editTool.tsx`).\n- The project uses `nodemon` for development, TypeScript for building the project, and `eslint` for linting.\n- Dependencies include `@gensx/openai`, `openai`, `zod`, and others.\n\n### Proposed New Goal:\n\n**Goal: Implement TypeScript interfaces for consistent data handling across the codebase**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- **Consistency:** Implementing TypeScript interfaces can help ensure consistent data structures and type checking throughout the codebase.\n- **Maintainability:** It improves the maintainability of the code by making it easier to understand the data flow and dependencies.\n- **Error Reduction:** Proper type definitions can reduce runtime errors and improve code reliability.\n\n**Steps to Achieve the Goal:**\n1. Identify key data structures used across different modules (`index.tsx`, `lease.ts`, `workspace.tsx`, and `agent` directory files).\n2. Define TypeScript interfaces for these data structures.\n3. Refactor the code to use these interfaces, ensuring all data handling adheres to the defined types.\n4. Validate the implementation by running the TypeScript compiler and ensuring there are no type errors.\n5. Run the test suite (if available) to confirm that existing functionality is not broken.\n\nThis goal will enhance the codebase by utilizing TypeScript's strengths, ensuring that data structures are well-defined and consistently used across the project.",

Locate the README.md file in the root directory.\n\n2. Create a new section in the README.md file. To adhere to the requirement, title this section 'A Trash Eating Raccoon's Tale'.\n\n3. Write a unique story from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer who is also a trash eating raccoon. The story should be one paragraph long, with 50% of the content in words and the other 50% expressed through emojis.\n\n4. Ensure that this new section aligns with the overall content and structure of the existing README.md file. The new section should provide a fun element and an interesting read while maintaining the professional tone of the document.\n\n5. Verify the markdown formatting of the new section. This includes checking that the section title is properly highlighted, the paragraph is well-formatted, and emojis are correctly displayed.\n\n6. After making the changes, preview the updated README.md to confirm that the new section 'A Trash Eating Raccoon's Tale' is properly displayed and that it meets the requirements.\n\n7. The expected outcome is an updated README.md file with a new, fun, and engaging section about an infrastructure engineer raccoon. The section should be well-integrated with the rest of the document, providing a light-hearted read while maintaining the overall professional tone of the README.md."
