# Self-Modifying Code

This example demonstrates a self-modifying code agent. The agent:

1. Creates a copy of its source code
2. Reads context about previous operations
3. Decides on a goal state
4. Modifies its source code to match the goal state
5. Runs tests to verify the changes
6. Starts a new version of itself to continue the work
7. Spins itself down and allows the new agent to take control

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the example
pnpm run start
```

## Killing all agents

On macos:

```bash
pkill -f "node.*examples/self-modifying-code"
```

## The Infrastructure Engineer Raccoon's Tale

In the bustling city, a raccoon named 🦝 lived. By day, he was an infrastructure engineer, by night, a trash connoisseur. "Servers up!" he chirped, adjusting 🖥️ with nimble paws. Yet, when the moon 🌙 rose, bins became his buffet. "Network stable," he assured, while munching on 🍟. With every dawn, he'd swap his trash crown 👑 for a thinking cap 🎩, ensuring the digital realm ran smooth. His life, a blend of bytes and bites, was as balanced as his speech - part words, part emojis.
