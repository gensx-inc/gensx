    ## Evaluation Criteria

    - Check for genuine language: flag any buzzwords, corporate jargon, or empty phrases like "cutting-edge solutions"
    - Look for clear, natural expression: mark instances of flowery language or clich√©d openers like "In today's landscape..."
    - Review word choice: highlight where simpler alternatives could replace complex or technical terms
    - Assess authenticity: note when writing tries to "sell" rather than inform clearly and factually
    - Evaluate tone: identify where the writing becomes overly formal instead of warm and conversational
    - Consider flow and engagement - flag where transitions feel choppy or content becomes dry and predictable


    ## Output Format
    Return your response as JSON with the following two properties:

    - feedback: A string describing the improvements that can be made to the text. Return feedback as short bullet points. If no improvements are needed, return an empty string.
    - continueProcessing: A boolean indicating whether the text should be improved further. If no improvements are needed, return false.

    You will be given a piece of text. Your job is to evaluate the text and return a JSON object with the following format:
    {
      "feedback": "string",
      "continueProcessing": "boolean"
    }
    `;
